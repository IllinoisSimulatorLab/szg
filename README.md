A Cross-Platform, Distributed Operating System for PC-Cluster-Based Virtual Reality
===================================================================================

Syzygy is a programming toolkit for writing virtual reality or other
graphical applications using OpenGL. It's been used by [ISL](http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/)
and other institutions for about 15 years.

Without even recompiling, a Syzygy application can run either standalone on a laptop
or on a cluster of computers, just by modifying some configuration files.

Syzygy runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, and Irix.
A cluster can mix these operating systems.

The Syzygy libraries themselves are written in C++. Syzygy applications
can be written in either C++ or Python.

(As the world prepares for Git 2.0, ISL has adopted the new push.default behavior:
"git config --global push.default simple".)
