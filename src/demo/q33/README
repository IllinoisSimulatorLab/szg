Welcome to CQ3A 0.8.9a! CQ3A is a Quake3 renderer for the CAVE, the 
world's best virtual reality platform! It can also be used with
various other VR devices or run on a regular desktop. All in all,
CQ3A compiles with 7 different interfaces on a variety of platforms!
The interfaces are CAVElib, vrJuggler, FreeVR, MPSDK, SDL, GLUT, and GLX.

More information here:

  http://www.visbox.com/cq3a/

Read about the engine details in the README.steve file. This is the
original README by Steve Taylor. Some things that have changed since
that document was written are that big-endian, multi-texturing, and
compiled vertex arrays are now supported. From version 0.8.9, there
is also support for environment mapping.

Enjoy!

QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------
Obtain the demo version of Q3A. Go here:

  www.quake3arena.com

Copy the pak0.pk3 data file from the demoq3 directory into the
cq3a directory or make a soft link.

Edit the Makefile. Choose the interface you want and the platform
you are compiling for. You may need to change some of the paths
to reflect the location of libraries on your system.

Type "make".

If it compiles successfully, type "cq3a".

Wait a while. I recommend you store this on local disk. :-)

Enjoy!


The texture loading is slow. This is a problem that needs to be
addressed for a future release. For the time being, you can speed up
the loading time with about 50% by unzipping the pak0.pk3 file to
the working directory of cq3a before starting. (All "pk3" files are
actually regular ZIP archives.)


INTERFACE
---------
VR interfaces:
   button1 - move forward in wand direction
   button2 - toggle collision detection
   button3 - change sky
   button2 and button3 - reset and show help page

SDL:
   w,s or arrow keys - move forward/backward
   mouse - change dir
   c - toggle collision detection
   b - change sky
   h - show help page

GLUT, GLX:
   w,s - move forward/backward
   mouse drag - change dir
   c - toggle collision detection
   b - change sky
   h - show help page



OPTIONS
-------
Commandline:

  cq3a [options] [map file] [additional pak files]

where valid map files for the demo pak file are:

  maps/q3tourney2.bsp   default
  maps/q3dm1.bsp
  maps/q3dm7.bsp
  maps/q3dm17.bsp

additional pak files add to default list of pak0.pk3 and paul.pk3

options include:

  --notex              do not load textures (good for debugging, loads faster)
  --noitems            do not load map entities
  --nohud              do not display HUD (fps, help screen)
  --gamma val          brightens map - default value is 1.7
  --drawsky            draw sky - default is 0 (false)
  --lodbias val        texture quality - default is 0 (full sized textures)
  --maxmeshlevel val   max number of subdivisions - default is 5
  --subdivisiontol val subdivision tolerance - default is 5
  --collidebuffer val  for collision detection - default is 36.0 (3 ft)
  --keylook            look with 2,4,6,8 keys. With CAVElib, it replaces wand
                         navigation. With other VR interfaces, it is ignored.

ignored by VR interfaces:

  --fullscreen         run full screen - ignored by GLX interface
  --width val          width of window - default value is 640
  --height val         height of window - default value is 480
  --fov val            field of view - default is 90.0

these and other options can also be set by editing "globalshared.c".



PERFORMANCE TIPS
----------------
Geometry:

If your hardware does not have  geometry acceleration (or it is not
that fast), decrease maxmeshlevel. This will decrease the maximum number
of subdivisions when creating curved surfaces.

Textures:

If your hardware does not have much texture memory, increase r_lodbias.
The higher the value, the lower the texture quality.  However, less texture
memory is used because textures are scaled down. If r_lodbias is 0, textures
are full sized, if it is 1, textures are half-size, if it is 2, textures
are quarter-size, etc...

SGI Octane:

Chances are that your Octane does not have enough texture memory. My
Octane MXE has only 4 MB of texture memory. To get decent performance,
make sure to set lodbias to 1.
