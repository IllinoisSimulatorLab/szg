teapots.py is from the PyOpenGL distribution; it's a port to
Python of one of the redbook OpenGL demos.

szg-teapots.py is the port of this demo to Syzygy. Besides
drawing the teapots, it allows you to fly around with the
joystick and randomly shuffle the teapots' positions by
pressing button #0. It's the simplest Syzygy Python demo.
