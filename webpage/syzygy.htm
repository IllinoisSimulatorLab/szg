<p>The first release of Syzygy on the web was in September 2000. An initial
paper posted to the web at that time generated a little bit of international 
interest (one citation in a conference paper by Chinese authors and some web 
links from Europe). In December 2001, Syzygy made Slashdot, which was its first
real publicity. Subsequently, it was featured in a panel discussion at IPT
2002 and was an important part of a SIGGRAPH class in PC cluster virtual 
reality in both 2002 and 2003. There now exist 5 PC cluster CAVEs running
Syzygy: one at the ISL, one at NCSA, one at UIUC's Krannert Art Museum
(the CANVAS), one in Berlin, and one in North Carolina. Syzygy has been used
as the primary visualization tool for 5 classes (as of this writing in March 
2005), both at the univerity and high school levels. In addition, it has been
used in 6 art projects: three projects shown in museums, one "tele-dance",
one UIUC faculty dance show, and one art conference installation.

<p>Syzygy has focused on providing high-performance, dynamic, and 
fault-tolerant distributed systems for real-time media (in particular 3D
graphics and sound). As such, it is much like many Grid operating systems
except for its application domain: multimedia instead of batch job submission
and control. 

<p>Syzygy's initial
motivating goal was to run a wide
range of VR applications on a PC cluster with equal performance
to shared memory SMP machines like the SGI Onyx, which had, up to then,
been the preferred platform for high-end VR. Subsequent work has focused on
making the system portable, robust, and easy to use, as well
as making the Syzygy application model better suited to new environments:
single PCs or laptops, wide-area networked systems, and even the shared
memory SMP systems that were once so important.

<p>Changes in hardware platform drives software changes. In this case,
fully supporting PC cluster application development requires explicit
library support and, indeed, an updated application model. Monolithic shared
memory systems allow library writers to ignore a whole range of
data sharing issues, leaving these to the applications programmer and
encouraging him to write non-portable code.

<p>Consider the requirements for PC cluster software in more detail.
Communications
between processors now becomes a bottleneck, and tools
are needed to efficiently manage and develop cluster applications. The
developer needs an API to facilitate complex communications between cluster
machines, remembering that these information exchanges must be fault-tolerant
and conducted in a way that keeps the
cluster producing synchronized views of the virtual world frame-by-frame.
During the early stages of application development, the application code may be
unstable. Consequently, the overall distributed system must tolerate the
failure of individual components: some of them will be user-produced and of
uncertain reliability. Finally, the system needs built-in monitoring tools,
so that users can remotely determine its state, the means for steering running
applications, and the ability to portably launch application across a wide
range of target clusters, both homogeneous and heterogenous in nature.

<p>The goal of creating VR applications on a PC cluster is best served by
increasing the level of abstraction and writing a toolkit with broader
applicability. Syzygy aims to provide simple software tools for building
heterogeneous distributed systems. While the system's main focus is PC
clusters on high performance LANs, it is also applicable to WAN-based
systems. Syzygy is designed to be a lightweight toolkit that can operate on PC
clusters, SMP boxes, and laptops, while connecting meaningfully with smaller
devices. This presents several challenges. Much system infrastructure is
unnecessary for a standalone laptop being used to provide a
portable road demo, and, to maintain ease of use,
the sytem's operation should scale down gracefully. Furthermore,
we need to deploy communication methods suitable for SMP,
namely shared memory instead of sockets, and do this while reusing our
low-level communications infrastructure. Finally,
performance is very important, as many of the toolkit's functions are OS-level
and must be efficient.

<p>Syzygy solves several problems: distributed graphics,
distributed sound, distributed
systems management, distributed data access, and general I/O device management.
There are systems out there that do each of these things, but no one system
addresses them all. However, each problem relies on a similar infrastructure
for its solution. Syzygy aims to identify that common infrastructure
and provide an implementation. Thus, each problem can be solved more
easily, and the resulting code base is well-integrated, maintainable, and
smaller. In effect, Syzygy is a middleware solution for distributed
multimedia.
