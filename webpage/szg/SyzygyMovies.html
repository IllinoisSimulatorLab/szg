    <li>The movies are in Quicktime format and range in size from 5 to 15 MB.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/cube-web.mov">Movie 1</a>: 
    Early video showing Syzygy
    inside the ISL's 6-sided Cube, as run by a PC cluster.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/syzygy-features-web.mov">Movie 2</a>: 
    Video shown at IEEE
    VR 2003 demonstrating Syzygy's fault-tolerance, reliable operation, and
    high quality real-time graphics clustering. The neat thing is that this
    video shows a heterogeneous graphics cluster (Windows and Linux) 
    which had no genlocking at all between computers. Even under 
    these adverse circumstances, Syzygy does well.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/teleimmersion-web.mov">Movie 3</a>: 
    Syzygy was used for
    a number of experiments in teleimmersion during 2002. These are recorded,
    in chronological order, in this movie. First, the "magic mirror", where
    children put on motion capture gear and drove an avatar in a virtual 
    environment. Next, excerpts from a long-distance collaborative dance
    performance, as chronicled in more depth in movies 6 and 7. Finally,
    a "tele-sport" where two motion-captured participants in different 
    locations play a game together. This third segment is interesting in that
    it shows the motion capture environments in which the two "tele-sport"
    participants play, along with some real-time screen captures of what
    occurs in the virtual world.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/FairySports2-web.mov">Movie 4</a>: 
    Presented at VRST 2003. Longer shots of
    the "tele-sport" from the last segment of movie 3. These are real-time
    screen captures from the virtual environment. The first three pictures 
    along the web page sidebar show three perspectives on the experiment
    (virtual reality, participant 1, and participant 2). Inside the virtual
    environment, the participants push a ghostly blue torus back and forth
    across a playing field.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/hummingbird-web.mov">Movie 5</a>: 
    Shows a collaborative
    dance performance between a motion-captured dancer in Illinois and
    a live dancer in Los Angeles, from 2002.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/hummingbird-close-web.mov">Movie 6</a>: A different
    perspective on the collaborative dance performance.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/parametric-dance-web.mov">Movie 7</a>: Syzygy was
    used in a sequence of museum installations in 2003-2004 involving
    live dancers and motion capture technology. Instead of driving
    avatars, the dancer's motions drove "abstract information spaces".
    This movie shows what happened.
    <li><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/~schaeffr/danceparty-web.mov">Movie 8</a>: Shows a prototype
    Syzygy collaboration environment. A group of students prototype a
    virtual dance party using a video wall powered by a heterogeneous
    collection of PCs. A work in progress. 2004.
