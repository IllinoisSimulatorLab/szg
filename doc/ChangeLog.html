<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Change Log</font>
<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.7 and szg-0.6</font>
<p><ul>
<li>Changed the mechanism by which alternative config file and login file
locations are determined for Phleet. There is no longer a -t option for
dname, dports, daddinterface, or ddelinterface. Instead, the SZG_CONF
environment variable, if set, gives the nonstandard config file location.
Similarly, SZG_LOGIN, if set, controls the location of the login files.
<li>Master/slave preExchange callack is now only called on the master. 
postExchange callback is not called on a disconnected slave. postExchange 
callback returns void, not bool. setInitCallback has been changed to 
setStartCallback because the callback is invoked during 
arMasterSlaveFramework::start().
<li>Changed arGraphicsWindow so it supports much more general drawing modes 
into a single window. Before, a few were hard-coded in, now things are fairly 
general.
<li>Added an arHead class to hold head-related data (eye spacing, mid-eye 
offset, eye direction), automatically shared
master->slaves and scene-graph controller->clients. Associated parameters
are read from the SZG_HEAD group by the master and scene-graph controller 
only (i.e. they
only need to be set on the master and trigger computers). It also holds the 
graphics unit conversion factor, simply because that's an application-wide 
constant and that was a convenient place to put it.
<li>Deleted the arScreenObject. Its head-related info was moved into arHead,
virtual screen location into the new arGraphicsScreen, and the frustum and
lookat matrix computations are done by the new arVRCamera class.
<li>Changed the way the arViewport interacts with the arGraphicsWindow
and the camera in setting up the rendering context & frustum parameters.
Among other changes, each viewport now has an associated eye sign and
OpenGL draw buffer (e.g. left or right). This will allow Ben to mix
active stereo & anaglyph in the same display (oooo!).
<li>The discovery packet/ response packet formats have changed to allow
    version numbers and also bring the interior contents up to date.
<li>TCP wrapper filtering has been improved so that lists and netmasks
    can be employed (essentially exactly like TCP wrappers now)
<li>dbatch format has changed. This allows "globals" not tied to a particular
    computer into the parameter database. This is needed for input node
    descriptions. It is also needed for pforth programs.
<li>dhunt/dlogin now work with netmasks != 255.255.255.0. And also play
    better with firewalls (i.e. use port 4621 on the return).
<li>PForth program no longer live in an XML file, but are instead embedded
    in the input node description.
<li>DeviceServer is now extensible via loadable modules.
<li>Python bindings plus system support for python executables has been
added (thanks Peter and Jim)!
<li>dll-ification has happened. Syzygy library is now built as dll's and
    szgd has been modified to support this.
<li>Changed the virtual computer set-up to include "location", which better
allows different virtaul computers in the same setting to play nicely with
one another.
<li>Possible to set-up the virtual computer to kill everything instead of
just the components determined to be incompatible at the launch of a new
application.
<li>None of the "killing" via arAppLauncher happens via names anymore but
instead via services and locks.
<li>Made the arSZGClient "stoppable" via remote kill (this fixes some 
weirdnesses with dkill -9. Now, the szgserver sends a "kill" packet to the
client, which cleans up all pending communications. Fixed some bugs in
arStructuredDataParser in the process.
<li>Fixed all the "jamming" issues in szgd and the arAppLauncher. The szgd
is now fully multithreaded.
<li>Have a working shared library implementation now.
<li>Added "stream playing" functionality to the sound.
<li>Added functionality to support "graphics peers" as a generalization of
arGraphicsServer and arGraphicsClient.
<li>The Irix port again seems to be working. This was a thread-safety issue
and has gone away with better Irix compilers. This issue is explored in
depth elsewhere in the documentation (including a simple test program to
diagnose whether your compiler is OK or not).
<li>Fixed the FOB driver so that it can be used with more general FOB set-ups.
<li>Added the "EASY" build style and improved the project template. There
is also a "make create-install" option which is perfect for making an
image of the library for development.
<li>Added support for streams to the sound API. This is important for
long sound files. Modified the SoundRender program so that it can export
the waveform (needed for Cube sound visualization).
<li>Added support for arMasterSlaveDataRouter to arMasterSlaveFramework.
This is an easier way of supporting object replication for complex systems.
<li>Added the ability to parse XML versions of arStructuredData over
network connections. This allows for easy RPC to szg apps.
<li>Added overlay and keyboard callbacks to arMasterSlaveFramework. This
makes it easier to do standalone mode.
<li>Fixed the concept of a custom camera in the arMasterSlaveFramework,
allowing applications that use non-euclidean geometry, for instance.
<li>Added "standalone" mode, which enables operation of applications without
the presence of an szgserver.
<li>Added rudimentary security to the szgserver. It is now possible to reject connections
based on incoming IP adddress (similar to TCP wrappers). Added because of the increasing
frequency of port scanning.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.6 and szg-0.55</font>

<p><ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: The location of the data for the demos has been changed. Make sure that you
    reorganize your data directory for the new method.
<li>IMPORTANT: Please re-read the basic documentation! The method of setting-up the
distributed system has changed!
<li>IMPORTANT: Phleet now uses connection brokering, via the szgserver, to determine
how components will connect to one another. This has many advantages, espcially in 
making initial set-up easier. However, YOUR OLD CONFIG FILES AND YOUR OLD
INFRASTRUCTURE EXECUTABLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW STUFF! Furthermore, the new
configuration resides at a different location on Windows computers, C:\szg\szg.conf. 
The config file location changed because Windows XP does not allow normal users to write
files to the top level of the C: drive.
<li>Because of the connection brokering, various objects, such as arNetInputSource,
arNetInputSink, arBarrierServer, arGraphicsServer, arGraphicsClient, etc. have
changed interfaces with respect to connections. If you based code on this layer,
you'll have some small changes to make. However, code based on the arMasterSlaveFramework
and arDistributedSceneGraph APIs is unaffected.
<li>A memory leak in the navigation framework on Win32 was fixed (a critical section
was being allocated over and over). Thanks CalState Hayward!
<li>The support for the wildcat hardware framelocking was improved.
<li>IMPORTANT: Syzygy now supports the latest fmod. 
It turns out that there's been an
API change between the original version we supported (3.4) and today's version
(3.7). Since it is impossible to find older versions, we've updated our
source code. This means you'll need to download and install the
latest dll's and header files if you want to compile Syzygy with sound support.
<li>Preliminary experimentation with incorporating NVIDIA's CG with the scene graph
has happened. More to come in the future! Thanks Mark Flider!
<li>SZGUSEOLD is now unused again. Instead autodetection of gcc version
includes the appropriate header.
<li>Loading of jpeg images is now supported in the arGraphicsDatabase and elsewhere.
<li>fmod support for Mac OS X has been added.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.55 and szg-0.5</font>

<p><ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: The "name translation" (szgtrans.conf) file format 
has changed! Now it begins with a magic character '#' and has names that
are delimited by parentheses. This allows for multi-token user names, as
might be found on Windows systems. Note that this means this version of
syzygy will not be able to coexist with previous versions.
<li>A C++-compilation issue has been introduced: namely <algorithm> is not
present on older Linux systems but it is the proper header to use. It seems
to do no harm to use the old-style headers, but if you want to use the new
one uniformly, go ahead and set the environment variable SZGUSEOLD to
false.
<li>Precompiled headers are now used on the Windows side, speeding up builds
by a factor of 2.
<li>Added support for Intersense trackers. Thanks Drew!
<li>Fixed a problem with the spacepad driver. It is now returning reasonable
values (before... the rotation matrix was screwy).
<li>Added syzygy support for vrpn. Thanks to Russ Taylor for guidance.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.5 and szg-0.4</font>

<p><ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: it is now necessary to set SZGHOME on Win32
for the cygwin build to succeed.
<li>Previously, szgserver would not run under Windows 2000.
Bug Fixed.
<li>Previously, host names beginning with a numeral confused
the sszgserver name resolution process on Windows.
Bug Fixed.
<li>The phleet protocol has changed greatly, mostly to allow greater
handshaking (and thus determinism) between components during 
application launch on a cluster. It is not compatible with previous
versions. See <a href="Phleet.html">this</a> for details.
<li>The graphics database has changed, adding more primitive types
and now correctly supporting OpenGL lights and materials. The new
API is incompatible with that found in version szg-0.4.
See <a href="SceneGraph.html">this</a> for details.
<li>The callback signatures for arMasterSlaveFramework have changed.
See <a href="Programming.html">this</a> for details.
<li>Stability and correctness have been greatly improved. 
<li>Graphics import filters and facilities for working with human
avatars are much better. Importing of OBJ files has been 
well-tested. And 3D Studio Max files can be imported via lib3ds.
We are also able to read htr files (a standard for describing 
human motion) and clothe these with segmented avatars. The program
szgview (a general purpose viewer for all supported types) is
now available.
<li>Modifications have been made to the graphics database to allow
distributed operation over a WAN (for distance telecolaboration).
<li>Increased input device support. We now have support for the
Ascension Spacepad, Ascension Flock of Birds, and the Motion
Analysis optical motion tracker. See 
<a href="InputDevices-Drivers.html">this</a> for details.
<li>A navigation/interaction framework has been added. This makes
it easy to add navigation to your program using a standard 
interface. See <a href="Navigation.html">this</a> for details.
<li>A extensible system for event filtering has been added, based
on the forth language. See <a href="PForth.html">this</a> for
details.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.4 and szg-0.3</font>

<p><ol>
<li>Executable names have been changed. This is true of many Phleet commands,
in an attempt to make them more keyboard friendly (for instance, changing
szgConnect to dconnect). Also, some service programs have seen name
changes, like SZGRender being changed to szgrender. See the rest of the
documentation, in particular
<a href="QuickStart.html">Quick Start</a> and 
<a href="Phleet.html">Phleet</a>, for details.
<li>Instead of many server executables for input device drivers,
a single one, DeviceServer, runs them all.
<li>Endian conversion works. We can communicate again between the
SGI and an x86 box. Also, Irix build problems are fixed.
<li>There is a communications incompatibility between the current version and 
previous versions. This is largely due to the endian-conversion fix. Old
and new versions cannot communicate with one another.
<li>A way to automatically launch applications has been added. One can now
define a virtual computer out of cluster components and launch an application
on it.
<li>Programming APIs have been deployed: arMasterSlaveFramework and 
arDistSceneGraphFramework. These simplify the work of making a VR application
using either the master/slave or distributed scene graph programming 
paradigms.
<li>Synchronization again occurs over TCP instead of UDP. This means that
you can run distributed graphics applications over low-latency WANs.
<li>A new sound API is fully integrated. Example code is in the
various shipping demos.
<li>Bug fixes in math code (ar_rotationMatrix).
<li>Input devices are all VR now. You can't use a joystick to control demos
anymore.
<li>Demo navigation unified. See the
<a href="Demos.html">demos</a> chapter for details.
<li>New SZG_RENDER configuration options. SZG_RENDER/frustum and
SZG_RENDER/lookat deprecated.  See 
<a href="QuickStart.html">Quick Start</a> for details. 
</ol>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.3 and szg-0.2</font>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Endian-conversion is currently broken! The
   arStructuredData::parse call breaks it. The next version of Syzygy will
   do endian-conversion upstream so that this is not a problem.

<p><ol>
<li>IMPORTANT API CHANGE: In szg-0.2, one could get the value of
   XXX/SZG_RENDER/size (where XXX is the local computer) via the command:

<pre>
   value = SZGClient.getAttribute("NULL","SZG_RENDER","size")
</pre>

   This will no longer work. Instead, use:

<pre>
   value = SZGClient.getAttribute("SZG_RENDER","size")
</pre>

   The 3 parameter version of getAttribute now means...

<pre>
   getAttribute(<parameter group>,<parameter>,<defaults>)
</pre>

   One can set defaults of "true" or "false" for a parameter "show_framerate"
   like so:

<pre>
   value = SZGClient.getAttribute("SZG_RENDER","show_framerate",
                                  "|true|false|")
</pre>

   If the parameter value in the database is neither "true" nor "false" then
   "true" is returned. This allows for code simplification in a common case.
   (The first value is chosen as the default.)

   Note that to manipulate values in the parameter databse associated with
   computers other than the local one, you'll need to use four parameters,
   with the last parameter the empty string if you want no defaults.

<pre>
   value = SZGClinet.getAttribute("air","SZG_RENDER","show_framerate","")
</pre>

   Note that this is a relatively uncommon case, only relevant to those
   doing systems programming with phleet.

<li>szgServer set-up is now vastly different. Broadcast communications using
   ports 4620 and 4621 allow for automatic set-up on a LAN. See
   SyzygyServer.txt for details. Also, the communication protocol between
   client and server is different. You cannot mix programs linked with 
   version-0.2 and version-0.3.

<li>The szgServer and related programs now have the concept of a user.
   Accordingly, you need to login (szgLogin) to have command line 
   programs work (with the exception of szgd). See SyzygyServer.txt for 
   details.

<li>Various demos have been added in src/demo. The distribution now gives a 
   self-contained means of going from cluster hardware to demo very quickly.

<li>A framework has been added for creating applications supporting 
   synchronization across multiple application instances. 

<li>All the demos look for their input devices based on the SZG_INPUT/IP
   and SZG_INPUT/port parameters. This cleans up matters a little bit over
   the previous method of having some programs look at SZG_JOYSTICK and
   some programs look at SZG_INPUT. Expect more work in this area in
   future releases.

<li>New environment variables that affect the build process have been added.
   Please check out the info about SZGEXTERNAL, SZGHOME, and SZGBIN in
   QuickStart.txt.
</ol>

<p><font size=+2>Changes Between szg-0.2 and szg-0.1</font>

<p><ol>
<li>You no longer need to run the BarrierServer program seperately to
synchronize rendering. This is handled internally by the arGraphicsServer
object now. In fact, running BarrierServer as before will cause the
software to fail!

<li>The synchronization uses UDP broadcast now for speed and scalability. In
a future release, the ability to use TCP instead will be returned. There
are some important consequences of the change.
  <ul>
  <li>Remote rendering only works over a LAN (routers filter broadcast packets)
     This is one reason why we want to return TCP functionality in the 
     future.
  <li>Synchronization ports for different render clusters on the same
     LAN need to be set differently. Remember that the graphics controller
     sends its synchronization information via broadcast.
  <li>Since UDP is connectionless, we use a TCP shadow connection to
     monitor connectivity between the master and slaves. Consequently,
     the synchronization software uses a block of 3 ports on each box.
     You cannot use your old port numbers for SZG_RENDER/sync_port if
     this block would overlap other ports. For instance, suppose you ran
     JoystickServer  from port 10003 and set the SZG_RENDER/sync_port to
     10001 previously. This would not work under the new set-up (a conflict
     at port 10003).
  </ul>

<li>The graphics API has changed completely (and gotten alot simpler). See
   GraphicsAPI.txt for details and rationale. Note that it is a 
   straightforward, mechanical exercise to translate your code. In both
   syzygy-0.1 and syzygy-0.2, you get graphics by altering an
   arGraphicsDatabase object via a stream of messages. In syzygy-0.1, this
   is handled directly by the programmer. In syzygy-0.2, a wrapper API
   is provided, and, in fact, the programmer is discourged from touching
   the database directly. In syzygy-0.1, there were two basic ways to get the
   data into the database, create node and alter existing node. These
   also exist in syzygy-0.2. Here's an example with a transform node.

<pre>
   Create node (0.1):

   theDatabase->alter(
     theDatabase->makeTransformData("world",0,"root",theMatrix));

   Alter node (0.1):

   transformNodeID = theDatabase->getNodeID("world");
     
   theDataBase->alter(
     theDatabase->makeTransformData("",transformNodeID,"",theMatrix));

   CreateNode (0.2):
   
   transformNodeID = dgTransform("world","root",theMatrix);

   Alter Node (0.2):
  
   dgTransform(transformNodeID,theMatrix);
</pre>

   Other calls can be similarly mechanically translated.
</ol>
