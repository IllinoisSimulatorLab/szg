<p>This section gives a general introduction to the Myriad scene graph and
explains its C++ API. There are several scene graph examples in C++:

<p><ul>
<li><a href="cplusplus/cosmos.cpp">cosmos</a>: Shows how to use the built-in navigation
classes, as well as the built-in shapes (with textures) and geometric primitves (lines).
<li><a href="cpluscplus/cubes.cpp">cubes</a>: Shows how to use the built-in interaction
code. 300 shapes float in space, their colors and orientations changing rapidly.
A grasping tool can be used to change their placement.
</ul>

<p> For a description of the (similar) Python API, please
see this <a href="SceneGraphTutorial.html">tutorial</a>. Python's internal reference counting
mechanism is integrated with Myriad's, so that their combined operation is thread-safe (with 
respect, for instance, to node deletions from an external source, as in the case of a shared
scene graph in peer-to-peer mode) and transparent to the programmer. There are several scene graph
examples written in Python.

<p>When reading this section, you'll first want to understand the 
<a href="#Design">basic</a>
design of the Myriad distributed scene graph, including how various kinds
of state (lighting, texturing, coordinate arrays) are
<a href="#Drawing">inherited</a> to guide rendering where it actually takes
place: at the "drawable" nodes. It is also important to understand how to
<a href="#Constructing">construct</a> a node tree and populate it using
<a href="#BuiltIn">built-in</a> objects, which is the best way to get 
something working quickly.

<a name="Using">
<p><font size=+2>Using the Myriad Scene Graph in Your Programs</font>
</a>

<p>The easiest way to use Myriad in your programs is via Syzygy's scene graph
application framework (arDistSceneGraphFramework), which is supported in both
C++ and Python. You will want direct access to the underlying arGraphicsDatabase, which
is provided by the framework's getDatabase() method.

<p>It is also possible to use arGraphicsDatabase objects directly in your programs,
without an application framework.

<a name="Design">
<p><font size=+2>Using the Myriad Scene Graph in Your Programs</font>
</a>

<p>The arGraphicsDatabase object is the fundamental tool for working with the
Myriad scene graph. It receives a stream of messages causing
it to alter its internal contents. These messages are either in
the form of arStructuredData or byte blocks which can be parsed into
arStructuredData. The alter() method receives arStructuredData,
while the alterRaw() method receives byte blocks, parses them, and
runs the resulting arStructuredData object through alter().

<p>The arGraphicsDatabase object manages a tree of arGraphicsNode objects.
The base class arGraphicsNode is subclassed to define the various
types of nodes, like visibility nodes, texture nodes, lines nodes,
etc. These objects have three important methods, receiveData(), draw(),
and dumpData().  Message streams sent to the arGraphicsDatabase via
alter()/alterRaw() are either routed to the arGraphicsDatabase itself,
like the message that requests a new node be created, or to a specific
node, via that node's receiveData() method.
For instance, a message might ask that a visibility node turn itself on or off. The 
draw() method renders graphics via OpenGL, and the dumpData() method serializes
the node, creating a message that can be used to
replicate that node in another arGraphicsDatabase.

<p>In Myriad cluster rendering, graphics state is synchronized across multiple 
machines by replicating
arGraphicsDatabase objects on each machine. An arGraphicsServer object
exists embedded in the application on the master machine and an arGraphicsClient object 
exists embedded in an szgrender on each render box (slave); both arGraphicsServer
and arGraphicsClient manage an arGraphicsDatabase.  When an 
arGraphicsClient connects to the arGraphicsServer, the server serializes the
state of its arGraphicsDatabase (using the dumpData() methods of its nodes)
and sends it across the network to the newly-connected arGraphicsClient, 
which then uses the alterRaw() method of its arGraphicsDatabase to recreate
the remote state. Subsequently, all alter() calls to the arGraphicsDatabase 
managed by the arGraphicsServer are mirrored over the network to those
managed by the connected arGraphicsClients. This message stream can be coordinated
with graphics buffer swaps on the render computers to ensure perfect state
synchronization at each draw.

<a name="Drawing">
<p><font size=+2>Node Inheritance and Drawing</font>
</a>

<p>Many operations, like drawing or intersection with a ray or bounding sphere, require traversing
the arGraphicsDatabase's tree. Tree traversal is generally depth-first, with child nodes visited
in the order they were added (though the permuteChildren(...) method of arGraphicsDatabase can
change this). 

<p>Tree traversal is made thread-safe with respect to node removal (from another
thread as might occur when the scene graph powers a shared world in peer-to-peer mode) via a reference
counting mechanism. The traversing process increments the reference count of nodes it uses (decrementing
the reference count when it is through with them). The owning arGraphicsDatabase, upon
receiving a deletion message, decrements the nodes' reference counts and removes them from its
internal tree. It does not delete them. Instead, a node deletes itself once its reference count has fallen
to 0.

<p><img src="images/SceneGraphInherit.jpg" width=450 height=544>

<p>Many properties related to drawing, like the active texture, material, points set, and normals set,
are inherited down the scene graph tree, from parent to child. As a tree traversal occurs, an arGraphicsContext object
keeps track, at each visited node, of the ancestor nodes that hold the active properties, and, at an arDrawableNode,
the active properties are used to actually draw a mesh. As an example, when the traversal passes an arMaterialNode
(going down into the tree) the active material is changed to the arMaterialNode's. Similarly, as the traversal passes
the arMaterialNode the other way (going back up the tree after visiting all nodes in the subtree), the active material
reverts to its previous value. In this way, the graphical characteristics of a drawable node only depend on its
ancestors, not on nodes to the left or the right in the scene graph. This localization is very important for
guaranteeing predictable results when node trees are combined.

<p>The following is a complete list of the properties used by the arDrawable node in drawing. If you are using the
built-in shapes only, the blend, material, and texture properties are the only relevant ones.

<p><ul>
<li>texture (arTextureNode)
<li>blend (arBlendNode)
<li>material (arMaterialNode)
<li>normal3 (arNormal3Node)
<li>color4 (arColor4Node)
<li>tex2 (arTex2Node)
<li>index (arIndexNode)
<li>points (arPointsNode)
<li>graphics state (arGraphicsStateNode)
</ul>


<a name="NodeTypes">
<p><font size=+2>Node Types</font>
</a>

<p><ul>
<li>transform: The type name for an arTransformNode. This node holds an OpenGL transform
(an arMatrix4 object in Syzygy). If transform node T1 has transform node T2 as a child, which
in turn has transform node T3 as a child, this is equivalent (in OpenGL) to:
<pre>
  glMultMatrixfv(T1.getTransform());
  glMultMatrixfv(T2.getTransform());
  glMultMatrixfv(T3.getTransform());
</pre>
<li>texture: The type name for an arTextureNode. This holds a reference to a texture object
managed by the arGraphicsDatabase. Drawable nodes descending from it will use it
when drawing their meshes.
<li>bounding sphere: The type name for an arBoundingSphereNode. Contains an arBoundingSphere.
Drawing uses this node for view frustum culling and picking uses this node for pick space
culling. These processes assume that any geometry contained in the nodes descendants is 
within the bounding sphere.
<li>billboard: The type name for an arBillboardNode. Displays a text string.
<li>visibility: The type name for an arVisibilityNode. Can turn traversal of the subtree of
its descendants on or off.
<li>blend: The type name for an arBlendNode. A little bit of a hack because of the way OpenGL
handles blending. The node holds a floating point value between 0 and 1. If 1, blending is ignored.
If less than one, the alpha component of colors is multiplied by the blend factor. When used
skillfully, this can create nice transition effects. Remember, then using OpenGL blending,
rendering order matters. Consequently, it may be necessary to reorder nodes in the tree
(see permuteChildren(...)) to get the desired result.
<li>light: The type name for an arlightNode. This contains an arLight, which describes an OpenGL 
light.
<li>material: The type name for an arMaterialNode. This contains an arMaterial, which describes
an OpenGL material.
<li>normal3: The type name for an arNormal3Node. This contains a list of 3D normals.
<li>color4: The type name for an arColor4Node. This contains a list of RGBA colors (with 32 bit floating
point components).
<li>tex2: The type name for an arTex2Node. This contains a list of 2D texture coordinates.
<li>index: The type name for an arIndexNode. This contains a list of integers. It is intended to
<li>points: The type name for an arPointsNode. This contains a list of 3D points.
<li>drawable: The type name for an arDrawableNode. It just stores a primitive type (like triangles, triangle strip,
quads, quad strip, etc.) and a number of primitives to draw. All the other information needed for drawing
is contained in the arGraphicsContext, which references state stored in the node's ancestors.
<li>graphics state: The type name for an arGraphicsStateNode. Turn lighting, depth testing, etc. on and off.
<li>persp camera: The type name for an arPerspectiveCameraNode. Stores a camera.
<li>viewer: The type name for an arViewerNode. Stores a user's head position (a VR camera).
</ul>
