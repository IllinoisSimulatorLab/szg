<p>Most input devices get their real-time data served up to other
Syzygy programs through a single executable, DeviceServer, which can be
configured to dynamically load various device driver modules at start up,
as is detailed in the chapter on <a href="InputDevices.html">input devices</a>.
In this chapter, we mention the input devices having drivers built in to the
core Syzygy software distribution. Please note that Syzygy's input framework
is extensible: you can write and compile your own loadable device drivers.

<p>Some devices have additional database parameters associated with them for 
configuration. These parameters are stored via
a <span style="font-style: italic;">service name</span>, corresponding to a
parameter group (e.g. SZG_JOYSTICK for joystick
devices), and should be associated with the computer on which DeviceServer
runs.

<hr><font size="+2">Device Drivers Contained in the Base Distribution<br>
</font><br>
The following are device drivers that interface with a single hardware
device. IMPORTANT: In general, for examples which require parameters, 
substitute the name of the computer on which you will be running DeviceServer 
for "TRACKER_COMPUTER".<br>

<font size="+1">Joystick<br>
<br>
</font>
<p>Loadable module: arJoystickDriver<br>
Platform: Linux and Windows.<br>
Service: none<br>
</p>
<p>Run this on a host with a joystick attached. Linux hosts use the
joystick device /dev/js0.  Win32 hosts use the default DirectInput
joystick. JoystickServer's data is in the format of 20 buttons and 20
axes, accessed through an arJoystickClient object. </p>
<p><br>

<font size="+1">Intel Wireless Gamepad<br>
</font><br>
<p>Loadable module: arIntelGamepadDriver<br>
Platform: Windows.<br>
Service: none<br>
</p>
<p>Run this on a Win32 host with an Intel Wireless Series Gamepad
attached. GamepadIntelServer emulates a joystick, so it sends data to an
arJoystickClient object just like "arJoystickServer". The two axes
correspond to the D-pad's horizontal and vertical axes; holding the
D-pad for a few moments increases the value.  The 20 buttons are the
following, in order:  A, B, C, X, Y, Z, L (left trigger), R (right
trigger); then the same buttons with the gamepad's shift key held down,
namely D, E, F, U, V, W, G, H;  then the HOME and END keys for the
gamepad's start button, unshifted and shifted.  Since Windows sees this
gamepad as a DirectInput keyboard, a normal keyboard can also be used. </p>

<p>Run this on a host connected via RS232 to a <a

dimensions, as well as two boolean-valued buttons.</p>

Matrix (a sequence of 16 floats, representing an 4x4 matrix, in OpenGL order)
by which we post-multiply the the matrix returned by the device.
This compensates for the possibility that the tracker antennae might be rotated
so that a sensor position that should be the identity matrix is, in fact, not
reported by the tracker that way.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_TRACKER sensor0_rot 0/0/1/-90

A rotation matrix by which we pre-multiply the matrix returned by the
device. This compensates for the possibility that we might place the
sensors on the wand or glasses in something other than the default position.
Here, the head sensor (sensor 0) has been rolled by 90 degrees (i.e. it's 
on the side of the glasses).

<font size="+1">Ascension Flock-of-Birds Tracker<br>
<br>
</font>
<p>Loadable module: arFOBDriver<br>
Platform: Linux/Windows<br>
Service: SZG_FOB<br>
</p>
<p>Run this on a host connected to an Ascension Flock of Birds motion
tracker. The Ascension Flock-of-Birds is a complicated device since it can
be configured in many ways. The Syzygy driver supports those configurations
that are attached via a single serial connection to the host computer. In this
case, the serial connection goes to one flock unit (the master), which itself
is connected to the other, slave, units. Each flock unit can have various
items attached: a transmitter, a transmitter, and a bird, an extended range
transmitter, or an extended range transmitter and a bird. Calibration-wise,
the Flock-of-Birds is handled exactly as the Spacepad.

<pre>
TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_FOB config 0/3/0/0

This parameter gives a list of codes (one per unit in the Flock) that gives
how each is configured. The codes should be listed in order of their internal
Flock IDs. The example parameter shows a four unit flock, where the first,
third, and four units only have a bird attached while the second unit has
an extended range transmitter attached.

  0: Bird attached
  1: Transmitter attached
  2: Transmitter and bird attached.
  3: Extended range trasnmitter attached.
  4: Extended range trasnmitter and bird attached.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_FOB com_port 4

The serial port to which the Flock-of-Birds is attached. Note that we only
use numerical IDs for the serial ports (not the OS-specific names). Serial
ports begin counting with 0 in Linux and 1 in Windows.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_FOB baud_rate 38400

The baud rate at which the Flock-of-Birds runs. This must be one of:
2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_FOB hemisphere lower

Sets the hemisphere of the transmitter in which our sensors are operating.
This must be one of: front, rear, upper, lower, left, right.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_FOB transmitter_offset -0.246783/0.016408/-0.968587/0.000000/0.160796/0.986350/-0.024259/0.000000/0.955287/-0.161785/-0.246135/0.000000/0.677432/7.824321/-1.981552/1.000000

Matrix (a sequence of 16 floats, representing an 4x4 matrix, in OpenGL order)
by which we post-multiply the the matrix returned by the device. This 
compensates for the possibility that the tracker antennae might be rotated so 
that a sensor position that should be the identity matrix is, in fact, not
reported by the tracker that way. Same as with the Spacepad.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_TRACKER sensor0_rot 0/0/1/90

A rotation matrix by which we pre-multiply the matrix returned by the
device. This compensates for the possibility that we might place the sensors 
on the wand or glasses in something other than the default position. Here, the 
head sensor (sensor 0) has been rolled by 90 degrees (i.e. it's on the side of 
the glasses). Same as with the Spacepad.

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_TRACKER sensor1_rot 0/0/1/180

Same as above, but for sensor 1 (the wand sensor).

TRACKER_COMPUTER SZG_INTERSENSE convert0_3 0/0/0/1.0

A 4x4 conversion matrix used to convert the Intersense coordinate system
to the Syzygy coordinate system. The 4th column (the translation) will
vary from installation to installation, but the first should be generally
applicable. Specifically,

( 0,  0, -1 )
( 1,  0,  0 )
( 0, -1,  0 )

Converts from Intersense coordinates to Syzygy coordinates.
</pre>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: You'll need to install the shared library (from Intersense)
as appropriate for your system to have this driver work.

<font size="+1">Motion Capture File<br>
<br>
</font>
<p>Loadable module: arFileSource<br>
Platform: All platforms.<br>
Service: none<br>
</p>
<p>This driver provides playback of previously-captured input data. It
does so at the same approximate rate as the file's internal time
stamps. The file read is "inputdump.xml" as located by searching the
SZG_DATA/path. An input event stream can be recorded by sending a
DeviceServer instance a "dumpon" message. The logging is ended by
sending a "dumpoff" message. The event stream will be saved in a file
"inputdump.xml" in the SZG_DATA/path. </p>
