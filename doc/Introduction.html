<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Introduction</font>

<p>The primary goal of the Syzygy software project is to run a wide
range of VR applications on a PC cluster with equal or greater performance
than on an SGI Onyx, the traditional platform for high-end VR.
This change in hardware platform drives software changes. Communications 
between processors now becomes a bottleneck and tools are needed to efficiently
manage and develop cluster applications. By developing a system that targets 
cluster-based VR from the beginning, one hopes to have a final product that 
will be pleasant to develop for and use. The Syzygy system will enable users
to run cluster applications between machines with different underlying
architectures, like x86 and MIPS, allowing old and new machines to work
together.  
 
<p>The goal of creating VR applications on a PC cluster is best served by
increasing the level of abstraction and writing a toolkit with broader
applicability. Syzygy aims to provide simple software tools for building 
heterogeneous distributed systems. The toolkit's main focus is PC clusters 
on high performance LANs, though it is also applicable to internet-based 
systems. It is designed to be a lightweight toolkit that can operate on PC 
clusters, SMP boxes, and laptops, while connecting meaningfully with smaller 
devices. This presents several challenges. Much system infrastructure is
unnecessary for a standalone laptop being used to provide a 
portable road demo. To maintain ease of use, the toolkit's operation should
scale down gracefully. Furthermore, we need to deploy 
communication methods suitable for SMP, namely shared memory instead of 
sockets, and do this while reusing our communications infrastructure. Finally,
performance is very important. Many of the toolkit's functions are OS-level
and must be efficient. 

<p>Syzygy needs to solve several problems: distributed graphics, 
distributed sound, distributed
systems management, distributed data access, and general I/O device management.
There are systems out there that do each of these things, but no one system
addresses them all. However, each problem relies on a similar infrastructure
for its solution. Syzygy aims to identify that common infrastructure
and an implementation. Thus, each problem can be solved more
easily, and the resulting code base is well-integrated and maintainable.
In effect, Syzygy attempts to create middleware suitable for multimedia on
clusters. 

<p><font size=+2>How To Use this Documentation</font> 

<p>The documentation is arranged into chapters.
Users of
earlier Syzygy releases should first read the <a href="ChangeLog.html">
Change Log</a> chapter
since there are incompatibilities with previous versions.
The change log suggests what to change 
in order to deploy the new version.
Next, the <a href="QuickStart.html">
Quick Start</a> chapter leads you step-by-step through the installation
of a Syzygy-based cluster environment. Advanced troubleshooting, especially
concerning Syzygy's distributed operating system Phleet, can be found in the 
<a href="Phleet.html">Phleet</a> chapter. The documentation also includes information
for application programmers, with two APIs for writing cluster-based VR
applications documented in the <a href="Programming.html">programming</a>
chapter.

<p>What Does "ar" Mean?

<p>A short look at the source code reveals that Syzygy objects all start
with the prefix "ar", which stands for "artificial reality".
