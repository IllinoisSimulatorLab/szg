<p><font size=+2>Where You Should Begin</font>

<p>In you are new to the Syzygy system, you should walk through the 
documentation's "Getting Started" system. There, you'll learn how to build,
or otherwise obtain, the software, run the sample applications in
"standalone" mode, how to set-up a Syzygy cluster, and, finally, how to
run the samples on your cluster. You should gradually work your way up
to full cluster operation, taking time to understand how Phleet, Syzygy's
distributed OS, works. You will also want to pay attention to how the included
applications are built and their data files are installed. This will make
it easier for you to get started writing your own portable cluster applications.

<p>After you feel comfortable with the introductory material, you can find out
more about how to <a href="ConfigurationExamples.html">configure</a> 
a VR system using Syzygy or how to use advanced <a href="Phleet.html">Phleet</a>
features in the "Addional Information" section. Finally, you can learn about 
<a href="CompileCPP.html">compiling</a> your C++ Syzygy programs or 
coding Syzygy in <a href="PySZG.html">Python</a>, along with
reading descriptions of some of the available APIs in <a href="Programming.html">Syzygy Programming</a>.

<p>Finally, please consider reading the overview at the bottom of this page to
get an idea of the motivation behind the software.

<p><font size=+2>What Does "ar" Mean?</font>

<p>A short look at the source code reveals that Syzygy objects all start
with the prefix "ar", which stands for "artificial reality". The "vr" prefix,
which would be another logical choice, is simply too common, and, in any case,
Syzygy is useful in arenas outside VR.

<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Overview</font>

<p>The first release of Syzygy on the web was in September 2000. Its initial
motivating goal was to run a wide
range of VR applications on a PC cluster with equal performance
to shared memory SMP machines like the SGI Onyx, which had, up to then,
been the preferred platform for high-end VR. Subsequent work has focused on
making the system portable, robust, and easy to use, as well
as making the Syzygy application model better suited to new environments:
single PCs or laptops, wide-area networked systems, and even the shared
memory SMP systems that were once so important.

<p>Changes in hardware platform drives software changes. In this case,
fully supporting PC cluster application development requires explicit
library support and, indeed, an updated application model. Monolithic shared
memory systems allow library writers to ignore a whole range of
data sharing issues, leaving these to the applications programmer and
encouraging him to write non-portable code. 

<p>Consider the requirements for PC cluster software in more detail.
Communications 
between processors now becomes a bottleneck, and tools 
are needed to efficiently manage and develop cluster applications. The 
developer needs an API to facilitate complex communications between cluster
machines, remembering that these information exchanges must be fault-tolerant 
and conducted in a way that keeps the
cluster producing synchronized views of the virtual world frame-by-frame.
During the early stages of application development, the application code may be
unstable. Consequently, the overall distributed system must tolerate the 
failure of individual components: some of them will be user-produced and of
uncertain reliability. Finally, the system needs built-in monitoring tools,
so that users can remotely determine its state, the means for steering running
applications, and the ability to portably launch application across a wide
range of target clusters, both homogeneous and heterogenous in nature.
 
<p>The goal of creating VR applications on a PC cluster is best served by
increasing the level of abstraction and writing a toolkit with broader
applicability. Syzygy aims to provide simple software tools for building 
heterogeneous distributed systems. While the system's main focus is PC 
clusters on high performance LANs, it is also applicable to WAN-based 
systems. Syzygy is designed to be a lightweight toolkit that can operate on PC 
clusters, SMP boxes, and laptops, while connecting meaningfully with smaller 
devices. This presents several challenges. Much system infrastructure is
unnecessary for a standalone laptop being used to provide a 
portable road demo, and, to maintain ease of use, 
the sytem's operation should scale down gracefully. Furthermore, 
we need to deploy communication methods suitable for SMP, 
namely shared memory instead of sockets, and do this while reusing our 
low-level communications infrastructure. Finally,
performance is very important, as many of the toolkit's functions are OS-level
and must be efficient. 

<p>Syzygy solves several problems: distributed graphics, 
distributed sound, distributed
systems management, distributed data access, and general I/O device management.
There are systems out there that do each of these things, but no one system
addresses them all. However, each problem relies on a similar infrastructure
for its solution. Syzygy aims to identify that common infrastructure
and provide an implementation. Thus, each problem can be solved more
easily, and the resulting code base is well-integrated, maintainable, and 
smaller. In effect, Syzygy is a middleware solution for distributed
multimedia.
