<p>It is possible to pause a running distributed scene graph
application by (where X is one of the szgrender's component IDs): </p>
<pre>  dmsg X pause on<br></pre>
<p>The application will be un-paused by the following command: </p>
<pre>  dmsg X pause off<br></pre>
<p>The application's framerate can be throttled at 5 fps by: </p>
<pre>  dmsg X delay on<br></pre>
<p>This effect will be turned off via: </p>
<pre>  dmsg X delay off<br></pre>
<p>A screenshot starting at raster position (A,B) and with width C and
height D will be taken and stored at the top of the SZG_DATA/path as
screenshot.Y.ppm, where Y is an integer representing the number of
screenshots taken since the component was launched, when the following
command is issued: </p>
<pre>  dmsg X screenshot A/B/C/D<br></pre>
<p>The view mode (see view_mode database parameter below) can be changed by sending the viewmode
message, with one from the same set of values as for the view_mode
parameter, e.g. it can be set to anaglyph by:</p>
<pre>  dmsg X viewmode anaglyph<br></pre>
<p>These commands also work with the master/slave applications. In this
case, X should be the component ID of one of the application instances.
