<br>
<p>Syzygy contains
tools to make driving around inside virtual worlds easy to implement. In
fact, if you're using one of the <a href="Programming.html">application
frameworks</a>, you may only need to make two function calls.</p>

<p>There are two
levels of support for navigation. <i>math/arNavigationUtilities.{h,cpp}</i>
contains tools for setting
and reading a global navigation matrix and for converting points, vector
offsets, and matrices between input coordinates and navigation
coordinates. You can use these routines even if you're not using one of
the application frameworks. The application frameworks also provide a
navigation interface that handles automatic event-processing for
navigation. This interface is currently based on the routines in
arNavigationUtilities; however, although easy to use the
arNavigationUtilities place an undesirable restriction on the structure
of virtual worlds, so we expect to be changing the underlying framework
navigation code in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p>The drawback is
that you can't have any transformations between the navigation matrix
and each object's placement matrix (placement = position + orientation),
or transformations between input and navigation coordinates will fail.
In other words, you can't have a transformation tree in which an
object's placement is specified relative to a parent object; instead,
all object placement matrices have to be computed with respect to a
global coordinate system. We plan to eventually use the Syzygy graphics
database (which each framework maintains a copy of) to control a
transformation tree, with tools to calculate transformations between
arbitrary nodes. Until then, so sorry, no transformation hierarchies if
you want to use the Syzygy navigation and <a href="Interaction.html">interaction</a>
tools.</p>

<p><b>arNavigationUtilities</b></p>

<p>These routines
manipulate a global navigation matrix. The matrix itself is hidden
inside a namespace (arNavigationSpace) and the accessor routines make
use of a mutex to prevent multiple simultaneous accesses. Conceptually,
you can treat the navigation matrix just like an object's placement
matrix; for example, to translate the viewpoint to (0,0,-5) you would
set the nav. matrix to ar_translationMatrix(0,0,-5). The inverse of the
navigation matrix should be loaded into the OpenGL modelview matrix
stack prior to rendering (the frameworks have routines for doing this).</p>

<pre>
void ar_setNavMatrix( const arMatrix4&amp; matrix );
    sets the navigation matrix.

arMatrix4 ar_getNavMatrix();
    returns the navigation matrix.

arMatrix4 ar_getNavInvMatrix();
    returns the inverse of the navigation matrix. This is computed once,
    then not recomputed again until the first request after one of the other
    routines changes the navigation matrix.
</pre>

<p>The following
two routines modify the nav. matrix by appending a translation or a
rotation.</p>

<pre>
void ar_navTranslate( const arVector3&amp; vec );
void ar_navRotate( const arVector3&amp; axis, float degrees );
</pre>

<p>These routines
convert a placement matrix, a point, or a vector offset between input
and navigation coordinates (a vector offset gets rotated but not
translated).</p>

<pre>
arMatrix4 ar_matrixToNavCoords( const arMatrix4&amp; matrix );
arVector3 ar_pointToNavCoords( const arVector3&amp; vec );
arVector3 ar_vectorToNavCoords( const arVector3&amp; vec );
arMatrix4 ar_matrixFromNavCoords( const arMatrix4&amp; matrix );
arVector3 ar_pointFromNavCoords( const arVector3&amp; vec );
arVector3 ar_vectorFromNavCoords( const arVector3&amp; vec );
</pre>

<p><b>Framework-mediated Navigation</b></p>

<p>The application
frameworks provide a simple interface for automatically converting input
events into navigation commands. Navigation commands are handled by the
arNavigationUtilities, input-event conversion is handled by the classes
in the <a href="Interaction.html"></a>interaction</a> directory.</p>

<p><u>Levels of behaviors</u>. Three levels of behaviors are available:</p>
<ol><li>The
frameworks have built-in default behaviors.</li>
<li>These
behaviors can be overridden by setting a few parameters in the Syzygy
database.</li>
<li>The first
two sets of behaviors can be overridden by calling framework methods
from within an application.</li></ol>

<p><u>Behavior
specification</u>. To determine behavior, you specify two things: the
nature of the behavior and the condition required to trigger it. Two
types of navigation behaviors are currently available. They are based on
the current state of an input event, e.g. in the case of viewpoint
translation you might hold a joystick at a fixed angle to travel in a
fixed direction at a fixed speed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Translation
at constant speed along the x, y, and z axes. If the input device is
tracked, the axes rotate along with the device, i.e. you point the
device axis in the direction you want to go. If you're using an axis
event to control the behavior (which can return negative values), then
negative values will translate in the opposite direction.</li>

<li>Rotation at
a constant rate about the y axis. In this case y always refers to the
vertical axis, no matter how the input device is oriented.</li>
</ol>

<p>A triggering
condition consists of an event type, and event index, and a threshold
value. For example, a condition of axis/0/0.2 would mean that the
specified behavior would happen whenever the absolute value of axis
event 0 exceeded 0.2. <i>Each condition is attached to a single
behavior; attaching a new behavior to a condition removes the old one</i>.
Currently it goes the other way as well, each behavior can only be
attached to one condition at a time; that latter part will probably
change in the near future. Multiple behaviors can be active
simultaneously if their triggering conditions are all met.</p>

<p>Translation and
rotation speeds are specified in feet/sec. and degrees/sec,
respectively. Note that the translation and rotation behaviors use
actual time measurements, so the speeds should be independent of frame
rate. Note also that both speeds are scaled by the actual value of the
triggering event, provided that value is between the threshold value and
1.0; in other words, if you're using a joystick that returns values that
vary depending on how far you move it, the speed will vary accordingly,
provided the driver scales the values to fall between 0 and 1.</p>

<p><u>Using
framework-mediated navigation</u>. To use these behaviors, you need only
do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you're
creating an application using the <a href="Programming.html">Distributed
Scene Graph framework</a>, use the <font face="courier" size="-1">
framework.getNavNodeName()</font> method to get the name of
the navigation matrix node and attach all of your object nodes to it.</li>

<li>Call <font face="courier" size="-1">framework.navUpdate()</font> to process input events
and update the nav. matrix. In a scene graph application, call it just
before (3); in an app. based on the <a href="Programming.html">Master/Slave
Framework</a>, call it in the <font face="courier" size="-1">preExchange()</font> callback.</li>

<li>Call <font face="courier" size="-1">framework.loadNavMatrix()</font> before rendering. In a
scene graph app. call it just after (2) and before <font face="courier" size="-1">
framework.setViewer()</font>
and <font face="courier" size="-1">setPlayer()</font>; in a master/slave app call it
near the beginning of the
<font face="courier" size="-1">draw()</font> callback.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a scene
graph app. example, see demo/cubes; master/slave apps. that use
framework-mediated navigation are demo/atlantis and demo/coaster.</p>

<p><u>Framework
default behaviors</u>. By default, the condition axis/1/0.2 triggers
translation along the negative z axis (forwards) and axis/0/0.2
translates along the x axis.</p>

<p><u>Database
parameters</u>. Setting the following database parameters (on the
control machine for a scene graph app., on the master machine for a
master/slave app) will modify the default behaviors.</p>

<p><font face="courier" size="+1">SZG_NAV/x_translation</font> sets the trigger condition
for translation in x. The first field must be either "axis" or "button",
the second a positive integer or 0, and the third a positive
floating-point value between 0 and 1, e.g. "axis/0/0.2".
<font face="courier" size="+1">y_translation</font>, <font face="courier" size="+1">
z_translation</font>, and <font face="courier" size="+1">y_rotation</font>
set the trigger conditions
for the other behaviors analogously. You cannot initiate the
world-rotation behavior from the database, that has to be activated by
the application.</p>

<p><font face="courier" size="+1">SZG_NAV/translation_speed</font> and 
<font face="courier" size="+1">rotation_speed</font> set the speed of the
translation behavior (in feet/sec.) and the rotation behavior (in
deg/sec) respectively. The translation speed is scaled by the
framework's unit conversion factor (provided that was set before calling
framework.init()), meaning that the translation speed in a particular
application will correspond to the number of application units/second
that map onto 5 feet/sec in input units (trust me, it makes sense).</p>

<p><font face="courier" size="+1">SZG_NAV/effector</font> allows you to specify the
input event ranges to use for navigation. This is a 5-element
'/'-delimited string of 0-or-positive integers. The first element is the
matrix index of the tracking device attached to the navigation device.
Elements 2 and 3 are the number of buttons and the starting button
index, elements 4 and 5 are the number of axes and the starting axis
index. This parameter defaults to 1/0/0/2/0, in other words, use matrix
#1 (#0 is generally assumed to be attached to the head), no buttons, and
axes 0 and 1 for navigation.</p>

<p><u>Framework
methods</u>. Calling the following framework methods from within an
application will override the two levels above.</p>

<pre>
bool setNavTransCondition( char axis, arInputEventType type,
                           unsigned int index, float threshold );
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>
bool setNavRotCondition( char axis, arInputEventType type,
                         unsigned int index, float threshold );
</pre>

<p>set a translation or rotation condition, e.g.</p>
<pre>    framework.setNavTransCondition( 'z', AR_EVENT_AXIS, 1, 0.2 );

</pre>

<pre>
void setNavTransSpeed( float speed );
void setNavRotSpeed( float speed );
</pre>

<p>set the
translation and rotation speed in <i>application units</i>/sec and
degrees/sec, respectively. When modified from this end, the value isn't
scaled by the framework conversion factor, but of course you can always
do that yourself.</p>

<pre>
void setNavEffector( const arEffector&amp; effector );
</pre>

<p>allows you to replace the
navigation effector (a representation of the input device used for
navigation).</p>

<pre>
void ownNavParam( const string&amp; paramName );
</pre>

<p>tells the
framework that the specified parameter should not be reloaded from the
database (clobbering the value we've just set in code) in response to a
"reload" message. The name is the database name without the SZG_NAV, e.g.</p>

<pre>    framework.ownNavParam( "translation_speed" );
</pre>
