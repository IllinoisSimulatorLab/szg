<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Portability Layer</font>

<p>Syzygy includes a portability layer which strives to make writing
cross-platform Unix/Win32 applications as simple as possible. We
examine each of the components in turn. One Syzygy design goal is to
ensure that all #ifdef's occur in these classes.

<p><font size=+2>Sockets</font>

<p>The arSocket and arUDPSocket classes provide a portable sockets API.
We make a few brief observations regarding this implementation.
The arSocket class wraps the native TCP socket implementation, hiding the
minor differences that exist (mostly in function names or call
signatures) between Win32, Linux, Darwin, and Irix.
When you create an arSocket object, you must specify whether it will
be used to accept connections (AR_LISTENING_SOCKET) or transmit data
(AR_STANDARD_SOCKET). For instance:

<pre>
arSocket* theSocket = new arSocket(AR_LISTENING_SOCKET);
</pre>

<p>Furthermore, each arSocket object has an associated numerical ID, which
can be arbitrarily set by the programmer. The intent is that a manager object
will be able to use these IDs to manipulate a set of sockets. Also, accepting 
a new connection via a socket looks like this:

<pre>
acceptSocket.ar_accept(&dataSocket);
</pre>

<p>Note that here "acceptSocket" is an arSocket object initialized with
AR_LISTENING_SOCKET and "dataSocket" is an arSocket object initialized with
AR_STANDARD_SOCKET. Some socket options are also set via class methods:

<pre>
bool arSocket::setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
  Sets the size of the TCP receive buffer.
bool arSocket::setSendBufferSize(int size)
  Sets the size of the TCP send buffer.
bool arSocket::smallPacketOptimize(bool flag)
  If flag is "true", Nagle's Algorithm is disabled. If flag
  is set to "false", Nagle's Algorithm is enabled. By default,
  most TCP implementations will have Nagle's Algorithm enabled,
  which interferes with the real-time performance of applications
  that send small packets at a relatively slow rate.   
bool arSocket::reuseAddress(bool flag)
  Only makes sense for a listening socket. If set to "true", then the
  socket can bind to a previously bound address.
</pre>  

<p><font size=+2>Threads</font>

<p>Threads are slightly different on Win32 and in the various Unix pthreads
implementations. Syzygy has a common abstraction, arThread, that wraps
the lowest-common denominator features. 
In the Syzygy case, all threads are detached once launched,
which is the only possible behavior in Win32 but must be explicitly enabled
under pthreads. Furthermore, thread functions must have the
following signature:

<pre>
void threadFunction(void*)
</pre>

<p>Note that this differs from pthreads, where threads are allowed to return
void*. 

<p><font size=+2>Mutexes/Locks</font>

<p>Locking is handled by the arMutex class, which is used much like
the corresponding pthread object, except without features not present under
Win32. Before being used, an arMutex object must be initialized:

<pre>
ar_mutex_init(&mutexObject);
</pre>

<p>Locking and unlocking are done like so:

<pre>
ar_mutex_lock(&mutexObject);
ar_mutex_unlock(&mutexObject);
</pre>   

<p><font size=+2>Condition Variables/Signals</font>

<p>Syzygy presents a lowest-common denominator abstraction for condition
variables and signals. In the case of signals, these are implemented via
arSignalObject. In this case, the arSignalObject enters a signalled state
when its sendSignal() method is called. It remains in a signalled state
until either the reset() method is called or a receiveSignal() method is 
called, at which time it returns to unsignalled. Note that receiveSignal()
blocks until the signal has been set.

<p>Syzygy condition variables, as implemented by arConditionVar, work
like pthreads condition variables except that only a single waiting thread
can be awakened by a signal() call. 

<p><font size=+2>Time</font>

<p>Syzygy provides a uniform way to query the system time. First of all, it
defines a time struct:

<pre>
struct ar_timeval{
  int sec;
  int usec;
};
</pre>

<p>It also provides a function for querying the time and one for calculating
the difference of two times:

<pre>
struct ar_timeval ar_time()
  Returns the current system time.
double ar_difftime(struct ar_timeval t2, struct ar_timeval t1)
  Returns the number of usec elapsed from t1 to t2.
</pre>
 
<p><font size=+2>Serial Ports</font>

<p>Syzygy provides the arRS232Port class for uniform access to serial ports. A
subset of the possible port parameters is supported. The constructor
takes no arguments. To open a serial port, call:

<pre>
bool arRS232Port::ar_open( const int portNumber, const unsigned long baudRate, 
            const unsigned int dataBits, const float stopBits,
            const string& parity );
</pre>

<p>Port numbers start with 1 on both platforms, i.e. under Linux /dev/ttyS0 is port 1.
The function returns a bool indicating success or failure. Currently supported parameter
values are:

<p><ul>
<li>baudRate: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 (additional values can easily be added).
<li>dataBits: 4-8 (Win32); 5-8 (Linux).
<li>stopBits: 1,1.5,2 (Win32); 1,2 (Linux.
<li>parity  : "none", "even", "odd", "mark", "space" (Win32); "none", "even", "odd", "space" (Linux).
</ul>

<p>To write to a serial port, use:

<pre>
int arRS232Port::ar_write( const char* buf, const int numBytes );
</pre>
<p>which attempts to write <em>numBytes</em> bytes, or
<pre>
int arRS232Port::ar_write( const char* buf );
</pre>

<p>which writes until a null character is reached. In either case, the function returns
the number of bytes actually written. Reading from a serial port is
accomplished with:

<pre>
int arRS232Port::ar_read( char* buf, const unsigned int numBytes );
</pre>

<p>On both platforms, this function will block until either a tenth of a second has passed
or at least one character has been read.  It repeats this step until either a user-specified
timeout has been reached or <em>numBytes</em> bytes have been read.  It returns the number
of characters actually read.  The timeout is set using:

<pre>
bool arRS232Port::ar_setTimeout( const unsigned int timeout );
</pre>

<p>which takes a timeout value in tenths of a second and returns a bool indicating success
or failure.

<p>To flush any characters from the input and output buffers, use:

<pre>
bool arRS232Port::ar_flushInput();
bool arRS232Port::ar_flushOutput();
</pre>

<p>To close the port, use:

<pre>
bool arRS232Port::ar_close();
</pre>
