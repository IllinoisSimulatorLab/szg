Introduction
------------

This document is an experimental attempt to come to terms with data formats for
the Syzygy environment. Things are likely to change as time goes on.

What are some issues?

1. Different data formats should be supported.
   a. Binary-only. Including or not-including relevant dictionaries.
   b. Text-only. XML-style.
2. Language definitions
   a. namespaces
   b. merging languages
3. Should each (text) data file be an XML document? Or a sequence of XML
   documents?
4. Valid names. The record names and field names should be valid XML element
   names. This is a small departure from what we've done so far.
5. How to represent binary data? Maybe a simple uu-encode?
6. How to handle string data? Especially string data encoded in a text file?
   Should there be some sort of normalization? And one also needs to deal
   with XML's reserved characters like '<' and '&'.
7. How about overall file formats? And versioning?

Simple XML Text Data Format
---------------------------

A Syzygy data record is, so far, simply a collection of named fields, each of
which corresponds to a primitive type. All primitive types are currently
arrays of either: char, int, float, long, or double. This should be expanded
in the future.

Each data record has a name, which uniquely identifies it in the context of
a dictionary. The dictionary encodes semantic information necessary for
decoding the data record.

Each data record has several fields, also named. A data record can have at
most one field with a given name.

Names, both for data records and fields, must be valid XML element names.
Simply put, this means that they must start with a letter and can contain
letters, numbers, and punctuation from {'.', '_', '-'}.

Suppose we have a data record that is described as follows
(yes, someday it would be nice to have an XML description...):

name = "experiment_info"
field 1 name = "calibration"
field 1 type = "float"
field 2 name = "session"
field 2 type = "char"

A particular instance might appear like this:

<experiment_info>
  <calibration>
    0.980 -0.342 -2.331 4.332
  </calibration>
  <session>Beckman Cube 5/4/03</session>
</experiment_info>

Please note that "char" fields cannot contain '&' or '<' in order to qualify
as valid XML. Consequently, these should always be replaced by their
espace sequences "&amp" and "&lt" respectively.
