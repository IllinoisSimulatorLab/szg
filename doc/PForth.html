<p>The modules arPForth and
arPForthStandardVocabulary implement the PForth (P for Pseudo)
language, which is used by the input filter arPForthFilter. Each
instance of DeviceServer contains an arPForthFilter, and so does
wandsimserver. The intent is to provide a means of performing simple
manipulations on input events based on information in a text file.
PForth is virtually identical in usage to Forth, except it has a very
limited vocabulary geared towards manipulating input events, and some
of the less informative word names have been changed (for example, "!"
and "@" have been renamed "store" and "fetch"). New words can be
defined from sequences of existing words, as in a Forth
colon-definition, or entirely new actions can be written in C++; see
arPForthStandardVocabulary.cpp for examples.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>arPForth Object Usage</b></font></p>
<p>If you don't need to install new C++
actions, there are only a few arPForth methods that you need to know:</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">bool
arPForth::operator!()</font> (as in
!pforth) returns false if initialization of the arPForth object was
successful.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">bool
arPForth::compileProgram( const string sourceCode )</font> compiles a
program and stores it internally.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">arPForthProgram*
arPForth::getProgram() </font>returns
a pointer to the current program so that you can re-run it later
without recompiling. Note that from this point on you own the pointer
and are responsible for deleting it. The program is cleared from
internal memory.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">bool
arPForth::runProgram()</font> runs the
internally-stored program.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">bool
arPForth::runProgram( arPForthProgram* program ) </font>
runs the compiled program pointed to by
'program'.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">vector&lt;string&gt;
arPForth::getVocabulary()</font>
returns the entire vocabulary. This is used in the arPForthFilter. The
idea is, you define filter words whose names match a particular
pattern. The filter extracts them from the vocabulary and creates
compiled programs for each of them, so that it can run the appropriate
program whenever it comes across a particular input event type.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Language Concepts</b></font></p>
<p>A PForth program is just a series of
words separated by whitespace. The set of words that PForth understands
is called the dictionary.&nbsp; These words typically operate on
numbers in a stack. Unlike Forth, the basic data type is a
floating-point number.&nbsp; There is also a dynamically-allocated
data space that can be used for storing variables and matrices (matrix
operations generally take place in the data space). Note that the data
space starts out with a size of zero, and must be grown using the
"variable" and "matrix" commands. Attempting to read or write from
unallocated data space will result in an error.</p>
<p>For most purposes, PForth programs
are all kept in the user's dbatch file, in a device definition. Here's an
example of an event-filtering
program that swaps matrices 0 and 1 (named swap_matrices_0_1.pf):</p>
<pre>define filter_matrix_0     /* Each time we come across a matrix event with index 0... */<br>&nbsp; 1 setCurrentEventIndex   /* ...change its index to 1 */<br>enddef<br>define filter_matrix_1<br>&nbsp; 0 setCurrentEventIndex<br>enddef<br><br></pre>
<p>For a more complicated example, here is a program that scales axes
0 and 1 from the range (-32,000, 32,000) to the range (-1, 1), swapping
the polarity of axis 1. It also maps axis 2 to axis 3, changing its
range from (0, 64,000) to (-1, 1), with a change in orientation. It
maps
axis 5 to 2, while changing its range from (0, 64,000) to (-1, 1).
Finally, whenever it gets an event on axis 1, it generates a constant
4x4
matrix. This filter is used to have a particular 2 analog stick gamepad
emulate a VR controller (to some degree). </p>
<pre>matrix temp                         /* Declare a matrix variable */<br>0 5 0 temp translationMatrix        /* ... and store a +5 y-translation matrix in it */<br><br>define filter_axis_0<br>  getCurrentEventAxis 0.000031 * setCurrentEventAxis  /* rescale axis value */<br>enddef<br>define filter_axis_1<br>  temp 0 insertMatrixEvent          /* Create new matrix event with index 0 and value from temp */<br>  getCurrentEventAxis -0.000031 * setCurrentEventAxis  /* ...and rescale this axis event */<br>enddef<br>define filter_axis_2<br>  getCurrentEventAxis -32768 + -0.000031 *   /* Get axis value, rescale, leave on stack */<br>  deleteCurrentEvent                         /* Delete current event */<br>  3 insertAxisEvent                          /* Insert stack value as new axis event #3 */<br>enddef<br>define filter_axis_3<br>  4 setCurrentEventIndex                     /* Change event index to 4 */<br>enddef<br>define filter_axis_5<br>  getCurrentEventAxis -32768 + 0.000031 *    /* Treat as axis event #2, except insert as new #2 */<br>  deleteCurrentEvent<br>  2 insertAxisEvent<br>enddef<br><br></pre>
<p>The idea is that a module that needs
a PForth program reads its name from the database, e.g. from
SZG_PFORTH/program_names. It then searches the PForthPrograms directory
for the .pf file of that name and reads it in and compiles it.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Vocabularies</b></font></p>
<p>PForth is dynamically extendable,
i.e. you can add new words on the fly. There are currently two defined
vocabularies, the standard vocabulary defined in
arPForthStandardVocabulary.cpp and the event-filtering vocabulary in
arPForthEventVocabulary.cpp.</p>
<p>I'll use the standard Forth notation
to indicate the effect each vocabulary word has on the stack. The
format is <font face="courier">(
&lt;stack contents before execution&gt; --
&lt;stack contents after
execution&gt; )</font>. I'll use
x# to represent a floating-point number, n# to represent an integer,
and addr to represent an address (an index into the
dataspace).&nbsp; A couple of examples: (1) <font face="courier"
 size="+1">( x1 x2 -- x3 ) </font>
means that the word needs to pop two numbers
off the stack and will push a single number onto the stack on
completion.&nbsp; Note that x1 must have been placed on the stack
before x2, i.e x2 is on top of the stack. (2) <font face="courier"
 size="+1">
( addr n1 -- )</font> means that the word will pop an address (a
positive integer) and an integer off the stack and not push anything
onto it.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>PForth Standard Vocabulary</b></font></p>
<p>These are basic math,
memory-management, and flow-control words. The first few words actually
take effect at compile time. They do not modify the stack or the data
space, but they may remove succeeding words from the input stream (the
program). This will be indicated by &lt;word&gt; or &lt;words&gt;. They
also typically add words to the dictionary. Note that additions to the
dictionary are permanent (i.e. last until the arPForth object is
destroyed) and attempting to redefine a word in the dictionary will
result in an error.</p>
<p>NEW 5/6/05: Added a bunch of words using (3-element) vectors, and several
array... words for performing element-by-element operations on arrays.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">&lt;number&gt;</font> (a string
representing a number, e.g. "123" or
"-12.5")</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, creates a
nameless action that will push the number onto the stack, and appends
that action to the current program or word definition. In other words,
typing a number into your program causes that number to be placed on
the stack at the appropriate point in program execution.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">variable </font>&lt;name&gt;</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, allocates
two cells in the dataspace and places the value 1 in the first one
(indicating a scalar). Then it adds a word &lt;name&gt; to the
dictionary that causes the address of the second cell to be pushed onto
the stack. This new word then acts as a pointer to the data cell.
Example: "variable x 12 x store" causes the number 12 to be placed in
the data cell pointed to by "x".</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">constant </font>&lt;name&gt;
&lt;number&gt;</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, it adds a word &lt;name&gt; to the
dictionary that causes the specified number to be pushed onto
the stack.
Example: "constant x 12 x" causes the number 12 to be placed on the
stack.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">matrix </font>&lt;name&gt;</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, allocates
17 cells, places the number 16 in the first one, and installs a new
word &lt;name&gt; in the dictionary that pushes the address of the
second cell onto the stack.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">array </font> &lt;numItems&gt;
&lt;name&gt;</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, allocates
&lt;numItems&gt;+1 cells, places the number &lt;numItems&gt; in the
first one, and installs a new
word &lt;name&gt; in the dictionary that pushes the address of the
second cell onto the stack.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">define </font>&lt;name&gt;
&lt;words&gt; <font face="courier" size="+1">enddef</font></p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, adds a new
word &lt;name&gt; to the dictionary. All succeeding words in the
program until "enddef" are compiled into the definition of
&lt;name&gt;; those words are executed each time after that
&lt;name&gt; is encountered.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">if </font>&lt;words&gt;&nbsp; <font
 face="courier" size="+1">else </font>&lt;words&gt; <font
 face="courier" size="+1">endif&nbsp; </font> ( x -- )</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, creates a
nameless action containing two subprograms. Words between "if" and
"else" are compiled into the first subprogram, words between "else" and
"endif" are compiled into the second.&nbsp; "else" is optional, if
omitted there is no second program.&nbsp; At runtime, the top value is
popped off the stack; if it is &gt;= 1, the first subprogram is
executed; if &lt; 1, the second. (NOTE: let me know if you can think of
a reason why the test should work differently, I just took the path of
least effort there).<br>
</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">string </font>&lt;name&gt;
&lt;words&gt; <font face="courier" size="+1">endstring</font></p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, allocates <em>a single cell</em> in the
separate string dataspace (yes, an entire string is an atomic variable
and they live in their own data space) and
installs a new
word &lt;name&gt; in the dictionary that pushes the address of the
cell onto the stack. This is intended to be used with the database
vocabulary (which hasn't really gone anywhere yet), e.g. you could get
the value of a database parameter and compare it to a string constant.<br>
</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">/* </font>&lt;words&gt; <font
 face="courier" size="+1">*/</font> (a comment)</p>
<p>Effect: at compile time, discards all words between the /* and */.
Remember that the delimiters must be surrounded
by whitespace. No runtime effect.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The remaining words have no
compile-time effects.</p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>The arPForthFilter PForth and
the Event-filtering Vocabulary</b></font></p>
<p>These are words for processing
arInputEvents. They are intended for use in the context of the
arPForthFilter. Each instance of an arPForthFilter is constructed with
an&nbsp; index value; it reads the database parameter
SZG_PFORTH/program_names, which is a slash-delimited string of program
names, and uses the item from this string specified by its index as its
program, reading it in from PForth_programs.xml. In order to define a
filter for a particular event type, you define a word whose name has
the format "<font face="courier">filter_&lt;event_type&gt;_&lt;event_index&gt;</font>
", e.g. "<font face="courier"> filter_matrix_0</font> " (see the
example above). This word will be
run each time a matrix with index 0 is encountered in the input stream.
The word has access to the current event and to the most recent state
of all other events via the following words:<br>
</p>
<p>NEW (08/13/04). Added four new filter words: <font face="courier">filter_all_buttons,
filter_all_axes, filter_all_matrices, and filter_all_events</font>. I
think these are
self-explanatory, but just to be sure, <font face="courier">filter_all_buttons</font>
gets
invoked for any button event. Note that a single event can now trigger
up to three
words; the more specific one comes first, e.g. <font face="courier">filter_button_0</font>
gets called before <font face="courier">filter_all_buttons</font>.
</p>
<p>CHANGED (05/09/04)!!!!! The order described above has been <em>reversed</em>! The
more generic words are now called first, <em>followed by</em> the more specific ones.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getCurrentEventIndex</font> ( -- n1)
Places the index of the current event on the
stack.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getCurrentEventButton</font> ( -- n1)
If the current event is a button event, places
the button value on the stack. If it's not a button event, it throws an
exception (which aborts the current PForth program) and prints an error
message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getCurrentEventAxis</font> &nbsp; (
-- x1) If the current event is an axis event, places
the axis value on the stack. If it's not an axis event, it throws an
exception and prints an error message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getCurrentEventMatrix</font> ( addr
-- ) If the current event is a matrix event, it
pops an address off the stack and attempts to copy the matrix to that
location in the dataspace. If it's not a matrix event, it throws an
exception and prints an error message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">setCurrentEventIndex</font> ( n1 -- )
Sets the index of the current address to n1 .</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">setCurrentEventButton</font> ( n1 --
) Sets the current event's value to n1 if it's a button event,
otherwise throws an
exception and prints an error message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">setCurrentEventAxis</font> ( x1 -- )
Sets the current event's value to x1 if it's an axis event, otherwise
throws an
exception and prints an error message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">setCurrentEventMatrix</font> ( addr
-- ) Sets the current event's value to the matrix
at location addr in the dataspace if it's a matrix event,
otherwise throws an exception and prints an error message.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">deleteCurrentEvent</font> ( -- )
Flags the current event for deletion by the
filter.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getbutton</font> &nbsp; ( n1 -- n2 )
Gets the value of button event # n1 and pushes
it on the stack.&nbsp; Returns 0 if that button event doesn't exist.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getaxis</font> &nbsp; ( n1 -- x1 )
Gets the value of axis event #n1 and pushes
it onto the stack. Returns 0.0 if it doesn't exist.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getmatrix</font> &nbsp; ( addr n1 --
) Stores matrix event n1 in the data cells
pointed to by addr.&nbsp; Returns identity matrix if event doesn't
exist.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">insertButtonEvent</font> ( n1 n2 -- )
Creates a new button event with index n1 and value n2 and inserts it
into the event stream.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">insertAxisEvent</font> ( n1 x1 -- )
Creates a new axis event with index n1 and value x1 and inserts it into
the event stream.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">insertMatrixEvent</font> ( n1 addr --
) Creates a new matrix event with index n1 and value taken from the
dataspace at addr and inserts it into the event stream.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>The Syzygy Database Vocabulary</b></font></p>
<p>The following words access the Syzygy database either explicitly or
implicitly:</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getStringParameter</font> ( addr1
addr2 addr3 --
) Uses the string at addr1 as the group name and the string at addr2 as
the parameter name, and
stores the returned value at add3. For example, if addr1 pointed to
"SZG_SCREEN0" and addr2 pointed
to "stereo", then after execution addr3 would point to either "true" or
"false" (assuming it
was set).</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">getFloatParameters</font> ( addr1
addr2 n1 addr3 --
) Uses the string at addr1 as the group name, the string at addr2 as
the parameter name, and n1 as the number of values to expect. addr3
should
point to an array of the correct size to hold the parameters For
example, if addr1 pointed to
"SZG_SCREEN0" and addr2 pointed
to "screen_center", then after executing "addr1 addr2 3 addr3
getFloatParameters", the array at addr3 would contain the 3 elements
of the screen center position.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Special-purpose Words</b></font></p>
<p>These words can replace the two C++ filters in arTrackCalFilter.cpp:</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">initTrackerCalibration</font> ( --
) Loads our position-correction lookup table for the MotionStar
tracker. It reads the same database parameters as the C++ version
(see szg/src/drivers/arTrackCalFilter.cpp): It looks for a file
with the name specified by SZG_MOTIONSTAR/calib_file (on the path
specified by SZG_DATA/path). The file format is the same also. After
reading in the lookup table, it adds the following word to the directionary:</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">doTrackerCalibration</font> ( addr1 addr2 --
) Reads an input matrix from addr1 and uses the lookup table to correct the
positional components, then stores the result at addr2.</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">initIIRFilter</font> ( --
) Initializes a positional IIR filter. It reads the same database parameters as the C++ version
(see szg/src/drivers/arTrackCalFilter.cpp): It reads 3 floats
specified by SZG_MOTIONSTAR/IIR_filter_weights (filter weights for x, y, and z),
then adds the following word to the directionary:</p>
<p><font face="courier" size="+1">doIIRFilter</font> ( addr1 addr2 --
) Reads an input matrix from addr1 and applies an IIR filter the
positional components, then stores the result at addr2. The filter is
<font face="courier" size="+1">output[i] = (1-w)*input[i] + w*output[i-1]</font>, where
output[i-1] denotes the output from the previous event.</p>
