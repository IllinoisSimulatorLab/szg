<p><font size=+2>Syzygy: Supporting Libraries</font>

<p>Syzygy's build system is designed to let you compile your software using
the optional supporting libraries but without installing them in a standard 
system location. This allows non-root users to compile Syzygy with supporting
libraries. The build system expects the "external" libraries to be installed
in a directory given by the SZGEXTERNAL environment variable. You will either
create this directory structure by hand or download an external directory
as part of the SDK.

<p>The Syzygy makefiles (via szg/build/make/Makefile.libscan) will 
automatically detect the presence of the libraries, given that they are copied 
to the places outlined below. See Makefile.libscan for details. This is the
file you should change if you need to use different library versions or
otherwise tweak this process for your local installation.

<p>The top level of the SZGEXTERNAL directory has subdirectories for each
system (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, SGI) that it supports. When creating
your own SZGEXTERNAL, you do not need all of these subdirectories, since you
might support only one or two system types.

<pre>
  SZGEXTERNAL
    darwin
    linux
    sgi
    win32
</pre>

<p>We now outline the subdirectories of each system-specific directory.
These vary, based on the supporting libraries for a particular platform.
As a general rule, each subdirectory will contain in turn "include" and "lib"
subdirectories. 

<pre>
  darwin
    fmod-3.7
    jpeg
</pre>

<pre>
  linux
    Coin-2.3
    VTK-4.2
    fmod-3.7
    glut-3.7
    jpeg
    lib3ds
    vrpn
    zlib
</pre>

<pre>
  sgi
    glut-3.7
</pre>

<pre>
  win32
    Coin-2.3
    GL
    STLport
    VTK-4.2
    ascension
    evart
    fmod-3.7
    glut-3.7
    isense
    jpeg
    lib3ds
    sapi-5.1
    zlib
</pre>

<p>For each system in turn, we now take a look at how to install the headers
and libraries. Please note: every platform requires GLUT. You do not 
necessarily need to install it in SZGEXTERNAL, but you will
certainly need to have it on your system. See the notes under each platform
section.

<p><font size=+2>Installing Libraries for Mac OS X (darwin)</font>

<p><ul>
<li>fmod-3.7
  <ul>
  <li>For sound support, install 
  <a href="http://www.fmod.org/">fmod</a> version 3.7.
  <li>Copy libfmod.a into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/darwin/fmod-3.7/lib.
  <li>Copy these include files into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/darwin/fmod-3.7/include:
      fmoddyn.h, fmod.h, fmod_errors.h, wincompat.h.
  </ul>

<li>glut-3.7
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Installing Libraries for Windows</font>

<li>Of special note is the STLport library. If you are using Visual Studio
6 to compile Syzygy, you CANNOT use the native STL. In this case, you MUST
use STLport (the software will crash otherwise). If you are using Visual
STudio .NET, you should use the native STL.

<p><ul>
<li>Coin-2.3
<li>GL
<li>STLport
<li>VTK-4.2
<li>ascension
<li>evart
<li>fmod-3.7
<p>For sound support, install 
<a href="http://www.fmod.org/">fmod</a> version 3.7.
<li>glut-3.7
<li>isense
<li>jpeg
<li>lib3ds
<li>sapi-5.1
<li>zlib
</ul>

<ul>
<li>For sound support, install
<a href="http://www.fmod.org/">fmod</a> version 3.7. You will need to download and
unzip (or untar) the file(s) appropriate for your platform(s).

<p>Then, before building Syzygy, copy these libraries as directed for your system:
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp libfmod-3.7.so into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/fmod-3.7/linux (Linux) 
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp libfmod.a into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/fmod-3.7/darwin (Mac OS X)
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fmodvc.lib into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/fmod-3.7/win32 (Win32)
<br>
And copy these include files into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/fmod-3.7:
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fmoddyn.h
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fmod.h
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fmod_errors.h
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp wincompat.h

<p>If you don't copy these files over, Syzygy will still build and run,
but the executable file SoundRender will print a warning message and exit 
instead of playing any sounds.

<p>Before running programs which use fmod (currently, only SoundRender),
place the fmod shared library where it can be found:

<p><ul>
<li>Linux: as root copy libfmod-3.7.so into /lib.
<li>Windows: copy fmod.dll into into your system directory ($WINDIR\system).
<li>Mac OS X: a statically linked version is used so no further action is needed.
</ul>
<p>
<li>In order to import jpeg images (needed for the q33 demo to compile), you will
need jpeg support. This feature is also useful for importing jpeg files into the
Syzygy library in general. First, obtain libjpeg from the web and compile it for your
platform. On a Linux system, this will not be necessary. However, in the Linux
case, you will have to copy already installed files to new locations, as outlined
below.
<ul>
<li> On Linux, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/jpeg/linux and copy libjpeg.a
there. Try 'locate libjpeg.a' to see if this is already present on your system.
Next, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/jpeg/linux and copy jconfig.h, 
jmorecfg.h, and jpeglib.h there. Once again, these files might already be on your
system and can be found using the 'locate' command.
<li> On Windows, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/jpeg/win32 and copy libjpeg.lib,
as produced by your compilation of the libjpeg sources, to there. Next, make a
directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/jpeg/win32 and copy jconfig.h, 
jmorecfg.h, and jpeglib.h there.
<li> On Mac OS X, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/jpeg/darwin and copy libjpeg.a
there. Try 'locate libjpeg.a' to see if this is already present on your system.
Next, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/jpeg/darwin and copy jconfig.h, 
jmorecfg.h, and jpeglib.h there. Once again, these files might already be on your
system and can be found using the 'locate' command.
</ul>
<p>
<li>In order to support compression/decompression of files (needed for the q33 demo
to compile), you will need zlib support. This is not used anywhere else in the code.
First, obtain zlib from the web and compile it for your platform.On a Linux system, 
this will not be necessary. However, in the Linux case, you will have to copu already
installed files to new locations, as outlined below.
<ul>
<li>On Linux, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/zlib/linux and copy libz.a there.
Try 'locate libz.a' to see if this is already present on your system. Next, make
a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/zlib/linux and copy zconf.h and zlib.h there.
Once again, these files might already be on your system and can be found using the
'locate' command.
<li>On Windows, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/zlib/win32 and copy zlib.lib,
as produced by your compilation of the library sources, to there. Next, make
a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/zlib/win32 and copy zconf.h and zlib.h to there.
<li>On Mac OS X, make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/zlib/darwin and copy libz.a there.
Try 'locate libz.a' to see if this is already present on your system. Next, make
a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/zlib/sarwin and copy zconf.h and zlib.h there.
Once again, these files might already be on your system and can be found using the
'locate' command.
</ul>
<p>
<li>In order to import .3ds files (Autodesk 3D Studio format),
you will need to build and install lib3ds. Included in $SZGHOME/contrib/ is a folder named
"lib3ds", which is simply the latest release of lib3ds, downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/lib3ds/">
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/lib3ds/</a>. Follow the instructions
provided in $SZGHOME/contrib/lib3ds/INSTALL to build the library. To install for
Syzygy compilation, follow the instructions for your platform:
<p><ul>
<li>Windows: Copy lib3ds.lib to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/lib3ds/win32. Copy all
    header files to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/lib3ds/lib3ds. 
<li>Linux: Copy lib3ds.a to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/lib3ds/linux. Copy header files
    as in the Windows case.
<li>Mac OS X: not supported yet, but this should be possible in the future.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Syzygy currently supports the Ascension Flock-of-Birds tracking system under
Windows. To enable this, you need to install the BirdWindowsDriver:

<ul>
<li>
Download BirdWindowsDriver.zip from 
	<a href="http://www.ascension-tech.com/support/downloads/">here</a>.
<li>
Copy Bird.dll to the appropriate location for your system
(e.g. in Win2k, to C:\WINNT\system32). NOTE: that this device is
currently supported only under Win32!
<li>
Copy Bird.lib to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/ascension/win32.
<li>
Copy Bird.h to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/ascension.
</ul>
<p>If Bird.lib is not installed correctly, make will succeed without Flock-of-Birds
support.  If Bird.lib is present but Bird.h is missing, make will fail.  If both
of these are present but Bird.dll is not installed, make will succeed but the device
driver will not run.
<p>
<li>Enabling EVaRT support: You should have received files EvaRT.h,
macrtcom.lib, and macrtcom.dll with your optical motion capture
system. 
<p><ul>
<li>Copy EvaRT.h into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/evart.
<li>Copy macrtcom.lib into $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/evart/win32.
<li>The build
process will detect the presence of EVaRT.h and macrtcom.lib and
will build executables with EVaRT support.
<li>Place macrtcom.dll in the path
of every Windows machine on which you want to execute.Alternatively, if your 
executables are accessed from a central location, just place the dll in the
same directory as your executables.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Enabling vrpn support: You can use vrpn (Virtual Reality Peripheral
Network, from UNC) to feed input events to Syzygy. Note that we only
support vrpn on Linux so far.
<p><ul>
<li>Download and compile vrpn.
<li>(on linux) Copy libvrpn.a to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/vrpn/linux.
<li>Make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/vrpn and copy the vrpn header
files there. Note that only vrpn_Shared.h, vrpn_Tracker.h, vrpn_Analog.h,
and vrpn_Button.h are needed.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Enabling CG support: This is currently only supported under Linux and
does not (yet) do much. We have added an experimental bump map node to the
graphics database API.
<p><ul>
<li>Obtain the CG developer's kit from NVIDIA. Compile (Linux) and copy
libCgGL.so and libCg.so to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib/Cg/linux.
<li>In $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/Cg, make a directory "Cg" and copy the header
files cg_bindlocations.h, cg_datatypes.h, cg_deprecated_api.h, cg_errors.h,
cgGL_deprecated_api.h, cgGL.h, cgGL_profiles.h, cg.h, and cg_profiles.h to
there. Note that the header files will be in $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/Cg/Cg.
<li>(Linux) Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable has $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib
in the search path. This is necessary since libCgGL.so calls libCg.so.
<li>The files cg_bump_mapping_fragment.cg and cg_bump_mapping_vertex.cg
need to go in /home/public/Data (yes, this is experimental). To change the
location, see src/graphics/arBumpMapNode.cpp. The aforementioned files can
be found in src/graphics.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Enabling VTK support: We just use this, so far, in the 2nd tier demo
vtkfile. At this early stage, you'll have to decode that demo's Makefile
to figure out how to make it work!
<p>
<li>Enabling vrpn support: Linux only. Using this library it is possible to
import data into Syzygy from any device supported by vrpn.
<p><ul>
<li>Obtain the vrpn source from the UNC vrpn homepage. Compile.
<li>Copy libvrpn.a to $(SZGEXTERNAL)/lib.
<li>Make a directory $(SZGEXTERNAL)/include/vrpn and copy the vrpn header
files there.
</ul>
</ul>
