<p><font size=+1>Setup/Building</font> <ul>

<li> Thread-safety issues... The Irix port does, indeed, seem to be working.
However, it seems sensitive to having an appropriately configured compiler.
(or maybe a recent enough version). Specifically, if the following test
program compiles and runs for a minute or two, then syzygy will run and be
stable.

<pre>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void* task1(void*){
  cout << "YYYY\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("yyy_test_name");
  }
  return NULL;
}

void* task2(void*){
  cout << "XXXX\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("death_by_xxx");
  }
  return NULL;
}

int main(int, char**){
  cout << "#####################################################\n";
  pthread_t ID1, ID2;
  pthread_create(&ID1,NULL,task1,NULL);
  pthread_create(&ID2,NULL,task2,NULL);

  // wait forever
  pthread_join(ID1, NULL);
}
</pre>

The compile script for Irix is simple. Here, we are assuming that the
program name is test.cpp.

<pre>
CC -n32 -LANG:std -c test.cpp
CC -n32 -LANG:std -o test test.o -lpthread
</pre>

NOTE: This would probably catch the thread safety problem on RedHat 7.x 
as well (?). Haven't really felt like re-installing something that ancient
however to find out.

<li>Some weirdness with libjpeg. Need better instructions for building this.
Specifically, turned out that the library suddenly started crashing on 
*one* Windows XP box. A fresh install seemed to do the trick. Here are the
steps (on windows): 
<ul>

<li> Before compiling, copy jconfig.vc to jconfig.h

<li> Before compiling, copy makefile.vc to Makefile

<li> Before compiling, edit jmorecfg.h so that:

<pre>
#ifndef XMD_H                   /* X11/xmd.h correctly defines INT32 */
typedef long INT32;
#endif
</pre>

becomes

<pre>
#ifndef _BASETSD_H_
#ifndef XMD_H                   /* X11/xmd.h correctly defines INT32 */
typedef long INT32;
#endif
#endif
</pre>

<li> Before compiling, edit Makefile so that

<pre>
$(cc) $(CFLAGS) $*.c
</pre>

becomes

<pre>
$(cc) $(CFLAGS) /MT $*.c
</pre>

<li>Type nmake (DOS prompt, not cygwin shell) to build the library.

<li>To install,
  <ul>
  
<li> Copy libjpeg.lib into $SZGEXTERNAL/lib/jpeg/win32
  
<li> Copy jconfig.h, jmorecfg.h, jpeglib.h into $SZGEXTERNAL/include/jpeg/win32.
  </ul>
</ul>

<li>The very latest fmod is NOT compatible with the headers we had
previously.

<li> Bad things happen on a Windows PC whose boot disk is not C: or D:.
  This can happen if it has a built-in card reader which grabs several
  drive letters, causing hard disks to start with F: or so.
  Since such a configuration causes many other problems, this isn't a
  priority to fix.

</ul>
<p><font size=+1>Configuration/Phleet</font> <ul>

<li>arFileTextStream error appears when using dname on a new computer.
<li>Need a handshake on connection establishment that is extensible and
includes space for a version number (to prevent mismatched stuff from
communicating).
<li>Phleet needs new methods! Specifically, we must be able to release
services. Also, need to be able to get service info from the command line!
<li>On windows, if c:\szg_USERNAME.conf is present, then dlogin does not look
at c:\szg\szg_USERNAME.conf. SERIOUS BUG since it impacts migrating to new
versions of szg.
<li>THE CURRENT CODE DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE NETMASK IS NOT 255.255.255.0.
(i.e. dlogin relies on broadcast and this will be incorrectly done). 
<li>There are spurious messages now (arFIleTextStream) when using
    /tmp/szg.conf instead of /etc/szg.conf.
<li>Need access control lists for szgserver, instead of just single subnets.
    (for instance, need to screen connections for szgserver BUT there are
     cases where multiple subnets need to be able to connect).
<li> On windows, c:\szg is used to store config info. HOWEVER, this would
be a natural place to put the szg code. This must change.
<li> On Mac OS X, dhunt does not seem to work. If you run an szgserver
on OS X and type dhunt on that box, the szgserver does not appear. Is the
problem filtering of the broadcast packets?
<li>BUG: if someone is looking for a service on network X but the
service is offered on network Y, the connection won't work, but the
service will disappear from dpending.
<li> Same computer name in szg.conf file on multiple computers
  destroys the system. We should be more robust!
<li>szgd will need to deal with library paths for loading dll's!!!!
<li> Double-clicking a program (like dps) works, when typing dps from a
  win98 dos shell fails:  try unchecking "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs
  from detecting Windows". (This is fast becoming an unimportant problem...
  since Windows 98 is less and less useful)

  </ul>
  <p><font size=+1>Graphics/Scene Graph/Database</font> <ul>

<li>Alpha value for textures is SERIOUSLY messed up! Alpha channel in 
textures doesn't quite work anymore. Specifically,
the drawing code only turns blending on if it thinks that the alpha is less
than 1 and the texture doesn't contribute to that as currently formulated.

<li>BUG: My switch for determining if a texture is a bit buggy! What if
someone uses an empty string for the texture name? (temporarily...) This
can result in a situation where you cannot download a database!

<li>Cannot reorder nodes. Sometimes drawing order needs to be changed 
like when transparency is used. And drawing order depends on node order.
Also, the nav node is attached first, so that its children are always
drawn before the non-navigated objects.

<li>Cameras are not handled very well in the arGraphicsDatabase. There is
genuinely draw state which currently exists (which camera is active) but
which does not appear in a dump. Furthermore, it is unclear how (if cameras
weren't global) how different camera-containing trees would be combined.

<li>Should be posible to draw .obj's without a graphics database.

<li>Need a way, in the scene graph, to turn on/off OpenGL properties.

<li>Should add mesh nodes (for simple shapes) to the database!

<li>Need to consider mutex locking/unlocking of get/set methods and how this
will work. For instance, it is not currently safe to get a matrix from a
transform node because someone else might be changing it in place!

<li>Need to support attach/detach for nodes in the database. This will
enable more natural semantics

<li>Need to use smart pointers for nodes! (our nodes may be deleted out from
under us)

<li>Thread-safety issues in terms of attaching/detaching a node and 
invoking methods of that node... when the way the methods are invoked will
changed based on whether or not it is part of a database!

<li>Need to be able to "insert" a node (not just make a child of a parent).

<li>Need to be able to delete a node, not a subtree (though deleting the
subtree is important as well).

<li>The node method calls are woefully inefficient for large arrays because 
they do not use prtIn.

<li>The node method calls should use an arStructuredDataParser to provide
storage instead or new/delete. This should be benchmarked against using
global (and NON THREAD-SAFE) storage!

<li>MUST CHANGE THE NAME OF THE PRETTYDUMP COMMAND (and maybe the way it
is implemented).

<li>dgSetGraphicsDatabase must be eliminated!

<li>The light direction seems to be wrong! (i.e. direction = (0,0,10,0)
    instead of direction = (0,0,-10,0)

<li>Things like arMesh and arOBJ etc. should have an implicit transform node
contained within them.

<li>3DS objects cannot have multiple parts! (i.e. only a single mesh 
element, which means only a single material). Very bad!

<li>obj parser does not show textures!

<li>Erase seems to have infinite erase problems!

<li>_Performance_ can segfault after running through the whole thng.

<li>Cannot erase dgLight nodes.

  </ul>
  <p><font size=+1>Python</font> <ul>

<li>Need to support more nodes in the python wrappers... i.e. all of them!

<li>IMPLICIT ARGUMENTS DO NOT SEEM HANDLED WELL BY SWIG (see the way
createNode crashes on an implicit name)

<li>On the python side, CANNOT GET THE POINTS ARRAY FROM THE POINTS NODE!
    (i.e. getPoints() does not work!)

<li>On the python side, obj.readOBJ does not work because of the path
argument!

<li>Must deal with the python examples (i.e. make them fit into the
pattern...)

</ul>
    <p><font size=+1>Other/I don't know</font> <ul>

<li>It would be helpful to have a string event type for the I/O framework
(i.e src/drivers).

<li>Our global init means that sockets cannot be declared globally!
(the solution is to eliminate the global init for WinSock, i.e.
arCommunicatorHelper) and make the arSZGClient do the init in it's init
OR, if no arSZGClient, we will go ahead and explicitly do it.

<li>The arDataServer should allow specific-socket-sending via HANDLES only.
This is because it actively manages the sockets (and there's the possibility
of a stale pointer).

<li>A weird bug. In standalone mode, with joystick (as in the standalone
landspeeder), if the pforth filter is in the old style 
(PForth_programs.xml) instead of the new style (*.pf in PForth) then the
program segfaults with an error message "arSyncDataServer error: start 
called before init".

<li>Double key presses on master (when standalone). [What does this mean?]

<li>FIX DOCS so that the various java whatnots no longer appear! They are
hereby superceded by the web server stuff!

<li>Must improve (and document) the unit tests that already exist for the
library. (For instance, the language unit test needs to test directory
operations, must be able to remove files (like Junk.txt), should test binary 
writing and reading, and needs the thread safety test integrated). Furthermore,
the OTHER tests should be documented (TestLanguageServer, TestLanguageClient,
phleettest, the service tests, etc.)
