<p><font size=+1>Documentation Errors</font>

<p><ul>
<li>The location of the lib3ds included should be lib3ds/include/lib3ds,
NOT lib3ds/include.
<li>Need to emphasize that shared libs must be copied into the exe directory!
</ul>

<p><font size=+1>Setup/Building</font> <ul>

<li> Thread-safety issues... The Irix port does, indeed, seem to be working.
However, it seems sensitive to having an appropriately configured compiler.
(or maybe a recent enough version). Specifically, if the following test
program compiles and runs for a minute or two, then syzygy will run and be
stable.

<pre>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void* task1(void*){
  cout << "YYYY\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("yyy_test_name");
  }
  return NULL;
}

void* task2(void*){
  cout << "XXXX\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("death_by_xxx");
  }
  return NULL;
}

int main(int, char**){
  cout << "#####################################################\n";
  pthread_t ID1, ID2;
  pthread_create(&ID1,NULL,task1,NULL);
  pthread_create(&ID2,NULL,task2,NULL);

  // wait forever
  pthread_join(ID1, NULL);
}
</pre>

The compile script for Irix is simple. Here, we are assuming that the
program name is test.cpp.

<pre>
CC -n32 -LANG:std -c test.cpp
CC -n32 -LANG:std -o test test.o -lpthread
</pre>

NOTE: This would probably catch the thread safety problem on RedHat 7.x 
as well (?). Haven't really felt like re-installing something that ancient
to find out.

<li>The very latest fmod is NOT compatible with the headers we had
previously.

</ul>
<p><font size=+1>Configuration/Phleet</font> <ul>

<li>Phleet needs new methods! Specifically, we must be able to release
services. Also, need to be able to get service info from the command line!
<li>BUG: if someone is looking for a service on network X but the
service is offered on network Y, the connection won't work, but the
service will disappear from dpending.
<li> Same computer name in szg.conf file on multiple computers
impairs the system. We should be more robust!

</ul>
  
<p><font size=+1>Graphics/Scene Graph/Database</font> <ul>

<li>Should be posible to draw .obj's without a graphics database.

<li>The node method calls are woefully inefficient for large arrays because 
they do not use prtIn.

<li>dgSetGraphicsDatabase must be eliminated!

<li>The light direction seems to be wrong! (i.e. direction = (0,0,10,0)
    instead of direction = (0,0,-10,0)

<li>3DS objects cannot have multiple parts! (i.e. only a single mesh 
element, which means only a single material). Very bad!


</ul>
<p><font size=+1>Python</font> <ul>


<li>Must deal with the python examples (i.e. make them fit into the
pattern...)

</ul>

<p><font size=+1>Miscellaneous</font> <ul>

<li>It would be helpful to have a string event type for the I/O framework
(i.e src/drivers).

<li>Our global init means that sockets cannot be declared globally!
(the solution is to eliminate the global init for WinSock, i.e.
arCommunicatorHelper) and make the arSZGClient do the init in it's init
OR, if no arSZGClient, we will go ahead and explicitly do it.

<li>The arDataServer should allow specific-socket-sending via HANDLES only.
This is because it actively manages the sockets (and there's the possibility
of a stale pointer). Another way to deal with this would be to add an
event processing API, so that socket delete occurs a little less automatically,
and to add reference counting to the socket class.

<li>A weird bug. In standalone mode, with joystick (as in the standalone
landspeeder), if the pforth filter is in the old style 
(PForth_programs.xml) instead of the new style (*.pf in PForth) then the
program segfaults with an error message "arSyncDataServer error: start 
called before init".

<li>Fix documentation to show how to use meshes (.obj and .3ds files) in
master/slave framework apps.
