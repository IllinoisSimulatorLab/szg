<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Known Bugs or Issues</font>

<p><font size=+1>Documentation Errors</font>

<p><ul>
<li>The location of the lib3ds included should be lib3ds/include/lib3ds,
NOT lib3ds/include.
<li>Need to emphasize that shared libs must be copied into the exe directory!
</ul>

<p><font size=+1>Setup/Building</font> <ul>

<li> Thread-safety issues... The Irix port does, indeed, seem to be working.
However, it seems sensitive to having an appropriately configured compiler.
(or maybe a recent enough version). Specifically, if the following test
program compiles and runs for a minute or two, then syzygy will run and be
stable.

<pre>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void* task1(void*){
  cout << "YYYY\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("yyy_test_name");
  }
  return NULL;
}

void* task2(void*){
  cout << "XXXX\n";
  while (true){
    string temp("death_by_xxx");
  }
  return NULL;
}

int main(int, char**){
  cout << "#####################################################\n";
  pthread_t ID1, ID2;
  pthread_create(&ID1,NULL,task1,NULL);
  pthread_create(&ID2,NULL,task2,NULL);

  // wait forever
  pthread_join(ID1, NULL);
}
</pre>

The compile script for Irix is simple. Here, we are assuming that the
program name is test.cpp.

<pre>
CC -n32 -LANG:std -c test.cpp
CC -n32 -LANG:std -o test test.o -lpthread
</pre>

NOTE: This would probably catch the thread safety problem on RedHat 7.x 
as well (?). Haven't really felt like re-installing something that ancient
to find out.

<li>The very latest fmod is NOT compatible with the headers we had
previously.

</ul>
<p><font size=+1>Configuration/Phleet</font> <ul>

<li>Phleet needs new methods! Specifically, we must be able to release
services. Also, need to be able to get service info from the command line!
<li> On Mac OS X, dhunt does not seem to work. If you run an szgserver
on OS X and type dhunt on that box, the szgserver does not appear. Is the
problem filtering of the broadcast packets?
<li>BUG: if someone is looking for a service on network X but the
service is offered on network Y, the connection won't work, but the
service will disappear from dpending.
<li> Same computer name in szg.conf file on multiple computers
impairs the system. We should be more robust!

</ul>
  
<p><font size=+1>Graphics/Scene Graph/Database</font> <ul>

<li>Alpha value for textures is SERIOUSLY messed up! Alpha channel in 
textures doesn't quite work anymore. Specifically,
the drawing code only turns blending on if it thinks that the alpha is less
than 1 and the texture doesn't contribute to that as currently formulated.

<li>BUG: My switch for determining if a texture is a bit buggy! What if
someone uses an empty string for the texture name? (temporarily...) This
can result in a situation where you cannot download a database!

<li>Cannot reorder nodes. Sometimes drawing order needs to be changed 
like when transparency is used. And drawing order depends on node order.
Also, the nav node is attached first, so that its children are always
drawn before the non-navigated objects.

<li>Cameras are not handled very well in the arGraphicsDatabase. There is
genuinely draw state which currently exists (which camera is active) but
which does not appear in a dump. Furthermore, it is unclear how (if cameras
weren't global) how different camera-containing trees would be combined.

<li>Should be posible to draw .obj's without a graphics database.

<li>Need a way, in the scene graph, to turn on/off OpenGL properties.

<li>Should add mesh nodes (for simple shapes) to the database!

<li>Need to consider mutex locking/unlocking of get/set methods and how this
will work. For instance, it is not currently safe to get a matrix from a
transform node because someone else might be changing it in place!

<li>Need to support attach/detach for nodes in the database. This will
enable more natural semantics

<li>Need to use smart pointers for nodes! (our nodes may be deleted out from
under us)

<li>Thread-safety issues in terms of attaching/detaching a node and 
invoking methods of that node... when the way the methods are invoked will
changed based on whether or not it is part of a database!

<li>Need to be able to "insert" a node (not just make a child of a parent).

<li>Need to be able to delete a node, not a subtree (though deleting the
subtree is important as well).

<li>The node method calls are woefully inefficient for large arrays because 
they do not use prtIn.

<li>The node method calls should use an arStructuredDataParser to provide
storage instead or new/delete. This should be benchmarked against using
global (and NON THREAD-SAFE) storage!

<li>dgSetGraphicsDatabase must be eliminated!

<li>The light direction seems to be wrong! (i.e. direction = (0,0,10,0)
    instead of direction = (0,0,-10,0)

<li>Things like arMesh and arOBJ etc. should have an implicit transform node
contained within them.

<li>3DS objects cannot have multiple parts! (i.e. only a single mesh 
element, which means only a single material). Very bad!

<li>obj parser does not show textures!

<li>Erase seems to have infinite erase problems!

<li>Cannot erase dgLight nodes.

  </ul>
  <p><font size=+1>Python</font> <ul>

<li>Need to support more nodes in the python wrappers... i.e. all of them!

<li>Implicit arguments do not seem not be handled well by SWIG (see the way
createNode crashes on an implicit name)

<li>On the python side, Cannot get the points array from the points node!
    (i.e. getPoints() does not work!)

<li>On the python side, obj.readOBJ does not work because of the path
argument!

<li>Must deal with the python examples (i.e. make them fit into the
pattern...)

</ul>

<p><font size=+1>Miscellaneous</font> <ul>

<li>It would be helpful to have a string event type for the I/O framework
(i.e src/drivers).

<li>Our global init means that sockets cannot be declared globally!
(the solution is to eliminate the global init for WinSock, i.e.
arCommunicatorHelper) and make the arSZGClient do the init in it's init
OR, if no arSZGClient, we will go ahead and explicitly do it.

<li>The arDataServer should allow specific-socket-sending via HANDLES only.
This is because it actively manages the sockets (and there's the possibility
of a stale pointer).

<li>A weird bug. In standalone mode, with joystick (as in the standalone
landspeeder), if the pforth filter is in the old style 
(PForth_programs.xml) instead of the new style (*.pf in PForth) then the
program segfaults with an error message "arSyncDataServer error: start 
called before init".

<li>Double key presses on master (when standalone). [What does this mean?]

<li>Fix documentation to show how to use meshes (.obj and .3ds files) in
master/slave framework apps.
