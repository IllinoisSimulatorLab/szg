<p><font size=+2>Running Syzygy Applications in Phleet Mode When Off the Network</font>
</a>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to be able to run Syzygy applications off the
network. On nice way to do this is <a href="Standalone.html">standalone mode</a>.
However, sometimes you will want to run in Phleet mode (as you would on a cluster),
but only on a single computer. Since Phleet mode requires a network connection 
and your operating system might turn off NICs if they are not connected,
the solution is to use the loopback address (127.0.0.1).

<p>First, you will need to make sure that the phleet configuration file is
set up with the loopback address. Use
the "daddinterface" and "ddelinterface" commands, as outlined in the
<a href="QuickStart.html">introduction</a> to produce a configuration file
that has "dconfig" produce output like:

<pre>
  Phleet configuration
    computer = your_computer_name
    network = local, address = 127.0.0.1, netmask=255.255.255.0
    ports = 4700 - 4899
</pre>

<p>Next, run szgserver, as outlined in the 
<a href="PhleetIntro.html">introduction</a>. An example (the given port number is
arbitrary):

<pre>
  szgserver my_server_name 4999
</pre>

<p>Finally, you need to dlogin. Since the loopback interface filters broadcast
packets, you need to connect by IP/port instead of via server name.

<pre>
  dlogin 127.0.0.1 4999 syzygy_user_name
</pre>

<p>The components of the parameter database can be divided into several
categories. Only one category, the executable paths, is necessarily specific
to a given user. Another category of parameters is those defining the various
virtual computers, and a third category is paths to various kinds of data
(sound files, texture files, and straight data files). The various input devices
can have configuration information stored in the parameter database (see
<a href="InputDevices-Drivers.html">here</a> for details). Finally, the
various graphics screens are configured via parameter blocks that take up the
majority of the database. The example parameter files below (which are in "dbatch"
ready format) are organized according to these categories.

<p>The file <a href="cube.txt">cube.txt</a> gives an example template parameter
file for a 6-sided VR environment (virtual computer=cube).

<p>The file <a href="lab.txt">lab.txt</a> gives an example template parameter file
for a lab containing a group of workstations, a dual-headed passive stereo
display (virtual computer=passive), an Immersadesk-style active stereo display
(virtual computer=idesk), and a 3x2 video wall (virtual computer=wall).

<a name="Parameters">
<p><font size=+2>Parameters Explanation</font>
</a>

<p>An explanation of the various graphics parameters follows. For the
sake of clarity, we use parameter group SZG_SCREEN0 but it could
just as easily be SZG_SCREEN1, SZG_SCREEN2, etc.

<pre>
  SZG_SCREEN0 size x/y

   If x=0 and y=0, this creates a full screen window. Otherwise, x and
   y give the appropriate window dimensions. If not set, the default
   is 640/480.

  SZG_SCREEN0 position x/y

   The x/y screen coordinates of the window origin. Default is 0/0.

  SZG_SCREEN0 tile A/B/C/D

   Used for working with tiled display walls. There are B horizontal tile
   and D vertical tiles. This particular tile is the (A)th horizontal one,
   with numbering starting at 0 and the display's left. The tile is the
   (B)th vertical one, with numbering starting at 0 and the display's
   bottom. Default is 0/1/0/1 (i.e. no tiling).

  SZG_SCREEN0 screen_center x/y/z

   Screen center in physical coordinates (feet). Default is 0/5/-5.

  SZG_SCREEN0 screen_dim x/y
  
   Screen dimensions in feet. Default is 10/10.

  SZG_SCREEN0 screen_normal x/y/z

   Outward pointing screen normal (away from the viewer), expressed in
   physical coordinates. Default is 0/0/-1.

  SZG_SCREEN0 screen_up x/y/z

   Up direction in physical coordinates. This can be used to correct for
   projector rotation. Default is 0/1/0.

  SZG_SCREEN0 stereo [true, false]

   Whether or not the screen should be drawn using active stereo. This requires 
   LCD stereo shutter goggles and a graphics card that supports OpenGL stereo 
   buffers. This parameter must be either "true" or "false", with the default 
   being "false". The Syzygy application frameworks query the graphics card 
   regarding stereo buffer support; if they aren't supported, this parameter is 
   ignored.

  SZG_SCREEN0 fixed_head [true, false]

   Whether or not the screen is using fixed-head mode. In fixed-head mode, the
   projection is determined based on a fixed head position and orientation. The 
   orientation depends on the screen_normal. Fixed-head mode is better than the 
   correct VR projection for a large group of people inside a projection-based 
   virtual environment. The default is "false". The actual fixed position is taken 
   from SZG_SCREEN0/fixed_head_pos.

  SZG_SCREEN0 fixed_head_pos x/y/z

   The fixed head position, in physical coordinates, that will be used
   if fixed-head mode is enabled. The default is 0/5/0.

  SZG_SCREEN0 fixed_head_up_angle x

   In fixed-head mode, the viewing head is oriented so that it is pointing
   directly towards the screen (as determined by screen_normal).
   Note that this leaves one degree of rotational ambiguity. This
   parameter (expressed in degrees) can be used to manipulate this.
   Default is 0.

  SZG_SCREEN0 default_eye [none,right, left]

   Normally, a nonstereo screen is displayed using a viewpoint
   midway between the two eyes. However, if this parameter is set,
   a viewpoint from either the right or the left eye can be selected.
   This is useful for building a passive stereo display system using
   2 computers, each displaying a seperate channel. Defaults to "none".

  SZG_SCREEN0 view_mode [normal,anaglyph,walleyed,crosseyed,overunder]
  
   It is possible to use syzygy to display passive stereo (i.e. not
   requiring LCD goggles) in a variety of ways. The possible view modes
   are:
   
     (1) normal: What it says. If active stereo is disabled, the scene
     is rendered once for the default view position (see default_eye,
     just above), by default taking up the entire window. If active
     stereo is enabled, it's rendered into the left buffer from the
     left-eye viewpoint, etc.
     
     Note that the following passive stereo view modes should work
     properly even if active stereo is enabled, i.e. if active stereo is
     enabled and the view mode is set to walleyed, the scene will be
     rendered four times, once each into the left and right halves of the
     window in both the left and right stereo buffers. It will look flat
     through LCD goggles, the left & right viewports will have to be
     fused for seeing 3-D.
     
     (2) anaglyph: The left-eye view is rendered into the red channel
     and the right-eye view is rendered into the green and blue
     channels, for viewing with red/green or red/blue glasses. Note that
     this only works well if the scene itself does not contain color
     information, or if large patches of color are restricted to the
     plane of the screen.
     
     (3) walleyed: The window is split in half, with the left-eye view
     in the left half and the right-eye view in the right half. This
     arrangement can be viewed with mirrors, or if the window is small,
     by diverging the eyes as for single-image stereograms. With a
     dual-head graphics card, the user can configure the desktop so that
     one output displays the left half and the displays the right half.
     
     (4) crosseyed: As above, but the left-eye image is on the right,
     and vice-versa. To be viewed by crossing the eyes.
     
     (5) overunder: The left-eye view is in the bottom half and the
     right-eye view is on top. For use with over/under stereo viewers
     like the View Magic (google it).

  SZG_SCREEN0 wildcat_framelock [true, false]

   If a wildcat board is present, should framelocking be enabled?
   Default is "false".
