<p>Many GLUT programs can be easily turned into Master/Slave
applications. A first step is creating a build environment that
is compatible with Syzygy. The final section of the
<a href="Programming.html">programming guide</a> addresses this
issue.

<p>In the source file containing main(),
<ul>
<li>
  <pre>
  #include &lt;szg/arMasterSlaveFramework.h>
  arMasterSlaveFramework* framework = NULL; // global so callbacks can use this
  </pre>
</ul>

<p>In main(),
<ul>
<li>
  <pre>
  framework = new arMasterSlaveFramework;
  if (!framework->init(argc, argv))
    return 1;
  framework->setXXXCallback(); ...
  </pre>

<li>
  Move any opengl state initializations into the init() callback
  demanded by the framework. Other application specific initialization
  should go here as well. The init() is called in the body
  of the framework's start() method (which does not return).
<li>
  Sometimes computations and data exchanges need to occur before
  the scene is drawn. Computations whose results need to propagated from
  master to slave should occur in the framework's preExchangeCallback(...),
  which occurs before the data sharing exchange between master and slaves.
  These computations might, for instance, transform input events into
  navigational information. On the other hand, if each slave bases its
  actions on the next input event, then work might occur in the
  postExchangeCallback(...), which occurs after the data sharing exchange
  between masters and slaves.
<li>
  You need to start the event loop in motion.
  
  <pre>
  if (!framework->start()){
    return 1;
  }
  // do not reach here
  </pre>
  
<li>
  If you called framework->start() from another thread,
  at the end of main do
  <pre>
  while (true)
    ar_usleep(1000000);
  </pre>
  so the app doesn't immediately terminate.
</ul>

<p>If your application needs to control the event loop and window creation,
you can start as follows (which returns and does not open a window):

<pre>
  if (!framework->startWithoutGLUT()){
    return 1;
  }
</pre>

<p> Thereafter, you need to invoke the preDraw() method before drawing and
the postDraw() method after drawing but before buffer swapping.

<p>Anywhere in the source code,
<ul>
<li>
  Don't call glutSetWindow().  Only one window.  Rewrite the user interface (ha!).
</ul>
