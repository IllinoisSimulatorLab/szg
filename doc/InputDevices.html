<p><font size="+2">Syzygy Input Framework Overview</font> </p>
<p>Input data in Syzygy comes in the form of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arInputEvents</span>. There are currently
three types of events. <span style="font-style: italic;">Matrix</span>
events, which usually represent the position and orientation (referred
to in combination as the <span style="font-style: italic;">placement</span>)
of a tracking sensor.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Axis</span> events contain a floating-point
number representing the state of a continuously-varying input. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> events contain an integer,
usually representing a binary on-off input device. Within each class,
events are identified by a 0-based index; in applications, a particular
event type and index is generally associated with a particular
function, for example matrix event #0 is generally assumed to represent
the position and orientation of the sensor attached to the user's head.
All three event types have a default value that will be returned
whenever an application requests an event outside the range of existing
indices; for matrices this is the identity matrix, for the other two
types it is 0.</p>
<p>For purposes of transmission and storage, arInputEvents are packed
into <span style="font-style: italic;">arStructuredData</span> records.
Syzygy provides functions for converting data between these two
formats. arStructuredData records themselves come in two formats, the
native binary format for network transmission and an ascii XML format
for storage on and retrieval from disk. Syzygy also provides routines
for I/O to and from XML-format files.</p>
<p>The transmission of input events is organized into trees; these
trees are created and managed by a number of <a
 href="InputClasses.html">input object classes</a>.
Input events coming in from separate devices on separate branches can
integrated into a single event stream, corresponding to a compound
virtual input device. In addition, events can be transformed, added, or
deleted by <a href="InputFilters.html">filters</a> at each node of the
tree. These filters can be either written in C++ or, for simple but
flexible filters, in the provided <a
 href="PForth.html">PForth language</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Input events currently originate either in a device driver or the
6DOF head &amp; wand tracking + joystick simulator program, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">wandsimserver</span>. All device drivers
are managed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">DeviceServer</span>
executable, with a separate instance of this program running on each
machine connected to a hardware input device. Each instance of
DeviceServer has a <span style="font-style: italic;">service</span>
name, corresponding to a group of Syzygy database parameters, that is
determined by the device driver it is running. An application checks
this group of database parameters for the IP address and port number to
connect to in order to receive input from that device. Here is a list
of <a href="InputDevices-Drivers.html">supported input devices</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Recognizing that many virtual worlds require similar navigational
functionality, the input framework includes support for standard <a
 href="Navigation.html">navigational methods</a> that can be easily
deployed in user programs. These methods are integrated with the two
Syzygy <a href="Programming.html">application frameworks</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, Syzygy also provides classes and functions to simplify the
handling of <a href="Interaction.html">interactions</a> between the
user and virtual world objects. Grabbing and dragging can be handled
with minimal effort different kinds of drag behaviors can easily be
added, and hooks are provided for implementing other kinds of
user-initiated object state changes.<br>
