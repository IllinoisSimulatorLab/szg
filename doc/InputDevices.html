</a>

<p>The Syzygy input framework has two programs that produce input events,
DveiceServer and inputsimulator. The first serves as a front end for
dynamically loaded device driver libraries, and the second is a GUI
intended to allow the generation of VR input events. Both programs
make their input events available over the network. Syzygy VR framework
programs can connect to get these events, as can any other client. 
For instance, DeviceClient can attach and print out, 10 times a second,
the data it has received. We now explain how to set up a DeviceServer and
test its behavior using DeviceClient.

<pre>
  DeviceServer -s [-netinput] driver_name input_slot [pforth_program_name]
  
    The "-s" flag causes the program to run in "simple" mode. Instead of
    trying to load an entire input node configuration, it just loads
    the device driver given by driver_name. If pforth_program_name is 
    specified, this program will try to load the text stored in
    the global parameter of that name as a PForth program and apply
    it to the input events from the driver. The input slot (integer) on
    which this program transmits events is specified by input_slot, and, 
    if the -netinput flag is specified, it tries to connect to input_slot+1 
    to receive events from the network.
  
  DeviceServer [-netinput] node_config_name input_slot [pforth_program_name]
  
    The same operation as above, except that the program configures
    itself according to the input node configuration in the global
    parameter node_config_name.
</pre>

<p>We now describe how to send joystick events from
one computer to another. First, plug a joystick into a computer in your Phleet,
dlogin on that computer, and type:

<pre>
  DeviceServer -s arJoystickDriver 0
</pre>

<p>If you (in your Phleet user identity) are not already transmitting on input
slot 0 elsewhere in the Phleet and your joystick is supported, DeviceServer will
start running and not return. Subsequently, open a new shell on that computer
and type:

<pre>
  DeviceClient 0
</pre>

<p>The raw event data from the joystick should now be printed at 10 second
intervals. Try pressing some buttons and wriggling some axes. You should see
the numbers change. If not, see the 
<a href="PhleetIntro#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section. You can
also run "DeviceClient 0" on other computers in the Phleet where you are
dlogin'ed as the same Phleet user. The additional copies will print out 
input information from the DeviceServer.

<a>Once this is working, you can experiment with using 
<a href="PForth.html">PForth</a> programs to 
filter the data. The following global parameter can be entered in a 
"complex" dbatch file.

<pre>
&lt;param&gt;
  &lt;name&gt; joystick_test &lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;
    define filter_axis_0
      getCurrentEventAxis 0.000031 * setCurrentEventAxis
    enddef
    define filter_axis_1
      getCurrentEventAxis -0.000031 * setCurrentEventAxis
    enddef
  &lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/param&gt;
</pre>

<p>Kill the DeviceServer you ran before. DeviceClient can keep running. After typing
the following, note how the values printed by DeviceClient change.

<pre>
  DeviceServer -s arJoystickDriver 0 joystick_test
</pre>

<p>Finally, we explain the input node configuration format. Two samples follow, as they
might appear in a "complex" dbatch file.

<pre>
 &lt;param&gt;
  &lt;name&gt; cube_tracker &lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;
    &lt;szg_device&gt;
      &lt;input_sources&gt; arMotionstarDriver &lt;/input_sources&gt;
      &lt;input_sinks&gt;&lt;/input_sinks&gt;
      &lt;input_filters&gt; arTrackCalFilter &lt;/input_filters&gt;
      &lt;pforth&gt;
	  matrix inputMatrix
	  matrix outputMatrix
	  matrix correctXRotMatrix
	  matrix correctYRotMatrix
	  matrix correctZRotMatrix
	  matrix correctHeadRotMatrix
	  -30 0 correctXRotMatrix rotationMatrix
	  6 1 correctYRotMatrix rotationMatrix
	  -1 2 correctZRotMatrix rotationMatrix
	  correctYRotMatrix correctZRotMatrix correctHeadRotMatrix matrixMultiply
	  define filter_matrix_0
	    inputMatrix getCurrentEventMatrix
	    inputMatrix correctHeadRotMatrix outputMatrix matrixMultiply
	    outputMatrix setCurrentEventMatrix
	  enddef
      &lt;/pforth&gt;
    &lt;/szg_device&gt;
  &lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/param&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
  &lt;param&gt;
  &lt;name&gt; idesk_tracker &lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;
    &lt;szg_device&gt;
      &lt;input_sources&gt; arSpacepadDriver arJoystickDriver &lt;/input_sources&gt;
      &lt;input_sinks&gt;&lt;/input_sinks&gt;
      &lt;input_filters&gt;&lt;/input_filters&gt;
      &lt;pforth&gt;&lt;/pforth&gt;
    &lt;/szg_device&gt;
  &lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/param&gt;
</pre>

<p>The configuration records for DeviceServer refer to the names of loadable
modules. These must exist on the SZG_EXEC/path for Syzygy to find them.
Assuming you have set this parameter correctly and have entered
the global parameters listed above into the database, you could type the
following command on a computer with both a spacepad and joystick connected:

<pre>
  DeviceServer idesk_tracker 0
</pre>

<p>When this DeviceServer starts up, it reads the configuration information
given by the global parameter "idesk_tracker". In the "input_sources" field,
it finds a list of module names (leaving off the trailing .so or .dll for
portability) which it will try to dynamically load as input sources. Recall
again that these modules must live on the SZG_EXEC/path to be loaded by
DeviceServer. Likewise, the "input_sinks" field gives a list of input sinks 
(subclasses of arInputSink) to be dynamically loaded, and the "input_filters"
field gives a list of input filters (subclasses of arIOFilter) to be
dynamically loaded. Finally, if the "pforth" field is nonempty, it contains
a PForth program to be applied to the data gathered from the defined
input sources before it goes into the chain of input filters and finally into
the input sinks.

<p>Input data in Syzygy comes in the form of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arInputEvents</span>. There are currently
three types of events. <span style="font-style: italic;">Matrix</span>
events, which usually represent the position and orientation (referred
to in combination as the <span style="font-style: italic;">placement</span>)
of a tracking sensor.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Axis</span> events contain a floating-point
number representing the state of a continuously-varying input. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> events contain an integer,
usually representing a binary on-off input device. Within each class,
events are identified by a 0-based index; in applications, a particular
event type and index is generally associated with a particular
function, for example matrix event #0 is generally assumed to represent
the position and orientation of the sensor attached to the user's head.
All three event types have a default value that will be returned
whenever an application requests an event outside the range of existing
indices; for matrices this is the identity matrix, for the other two
types it is 0.</p>
<p>For purposes of transmission and storage, arInputEvents are packed
into <span style="font-style: italic;">arStructuredData</span> records.
Syzygy provides functions for converting data between these two
formats. arStructuredData records themselves come in two formats, the
native binary format for network transmission and an ascii XML format
for storage on and retrieval from disk. Syzygy also provides routines
for I/O to and from XML-format files.</p>
<p>The transmission of input events is organized into trees; these
trees are created and managed by a number of <a
 href="InputClasses.html">input object classes</a>.
Input events coming in from separate devices on separate branches can
integrated into a single event stream, corresponding to a compound
virtual input device. In addition, events can be transformed, added, or
deleted by <a href="InputFilters.html">filters</a> at each node of the
tree. These filters can be either written in C++ or, for simple but
flexible filters, in the provided <a
 href="PForth.html">PForth language</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Input events currently originate either in a device driver or the
6DOF head &amp; wand tracking + joystick simulator program, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">inputsimulator</span>. All device drivers
are managed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">DeviceServer</span>
executable, with a separate instance of this program running on each
machine connected to a hardware input device. Each instance of
DeviceServer has a <span style="font-style: italic;">service</span>
name, corresponding to a group of Syzygy database parameters, that is
determined by the device driver it is running. An application checks
this group of database parameters for the IP address and port number to
connect to in order to receive input from that device. Here is a list
of <a href="InputDevices-Drivers.html">supported input devices</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Recognizing that many virtual worlds require similar navigational
functionality, the input framework includes support for standard <a
 href="Navigation.html">navigational methods</a> that can be easily
deployed in user programs. These methods are integrated with the two
Syzygy <a href="Programming.html">application frameworks</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, Syzygy also provides classes and functions to simplify the
handling of <a href="Interaction.html">interactions</a> between the
user and virtual world objects. Grabbing and dragging can be handled
with minimal effort different kinds of drag behaviors can easily be
added, and hooks are provided for implementing other kinds of
user-initiated object state changes.<br>
