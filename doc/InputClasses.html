<p><font size="+2">Syzygy Input Classes</font></p>
<p>There are three basic types of input classes: sources, nodes, and
sinks. An <span style="font-style: italic;">arInputSource</span>
receives events and feeds them to an <span style="font-style: italic;">arInputNode</span>,
which in turn relays them to one or more <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arInputSinks</span> after optionally <a
 href="InputFilters.html">filtering</a> them. An arInputSink may
transmit the events to some other location or may perform arbitrary
operations based on the input stream. The arInputNode maintains a list
of arInputSources and arInputSinks.</p>
<p>Two important arInputSource subclasses are the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arNetInputSource</span>, which receives a
stream of input events from a remote computer and makes it available to
the local process, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">arFileSource</span>,
which reads an event stream from a file and feeds it to the local
process, using the internal event time stamps to control the pace.
Corresponding arInputSink classes are the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arNetInputSink</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arFileSink</span>, which make an input
stream available over the network or write it to a file, respectively.</p>
<p>An arInputNode processes events using two subsidiary classes, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arInputEventQueue</span> and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">arInputState</span>. The arInputNode
receives an <span style="font-style: italic;">arStructuredData </span>record
from an input source and unpacks it into an arInputEventQueue. It then
passes each event in the queue through its list of <a
 href="InputFilters.html">arIOFilters</a>. For each stage in this
filtering chain it maintains an arInputState representing the most
recent values of all received events; this allows the filter to perform
computations based on the current event and the most recent state of
all other events. Finally, it packs the filtered event queue into a new
arStructuredData record and passes it to each of its arInputSinks.</p>
