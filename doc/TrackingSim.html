<p><font size=+2>Syzygy: Tracking Simulator</font>

<p>Since we are a VR installation, syzygy works best with a VR-style
interface, namely 6DOF head tracking and some kind of joystick type input
device with another 6DOF sensor attached. Since this could very easily be
unavailable, the software includes support for a simulator (wandsimserver)
that can operate the included programs from a desktop.

<p>This program can be run either from the command line or via

<pre>
    dex XXX wandsimserver
</pre>

<p>While executing, wandsimserver opens a window showing a view from behind into
a 10-foot cubical space (remarkably reminiscent of the inside our CUBE). A wireframe
sphere in the center represents the subject's head (initially facing away from us).
The other visible object represents a wand with three buttons. wandsimserver sends
data to the application specifying the position and orientation of
the head and of the wand and the state of the wand's buttons.

<p>When using the simulator, there are several modes, selected by the keys
1-7. 
<p><ol>
<li>Move the head. Mousing with the left button down moves head in the screen plane.
   Mouse with the middle button down moves head into/ out of the screen.
<li>Rotate head. Mousing with the left button down rotates head around the y axis.
   Mouse with the middle button down rotates the head around the x axis.
<li>Translate wand: Mousing with the left button down translates the wand in the
   screen plane. Mouse with the middle button down translates the wand into
   and out of the screen. 
<li>Translate wand & use buttons: Mouse movement translates the wand in the
   x-y plane. Pressing mouse buttons activates the device buttons.
<li>Rotate the wand & use buttons: Mouse movement causes the wand to rotate.
   Pressing buttons activates the mouse buttons. 
<li>Use the joystick: While a mouse button is pressed,
   mousing moves the joystick.
<li>Rotate the world: When a mouse button is pressed, the view rotates around
   the y axis.
<li>The wandsimserver program emulates the use of a wand with 6 buttons.
    By pressing the space bar, you can change the mapping of the mouse buttons
    from wand buttons 1-3 to wand button 4-6 and back again.
