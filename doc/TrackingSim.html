<p><font size=+2>Syzygy: Tracking Simulator</font>

<p>The Syzygy VR framework applications tend to work best with a VR style
interface, namely 6DOF head tracking and some kind of joystick type input
device with another 6DOF sensor attached. Since this could very easily be
unavailable, the software includes support for a simulator (inputsimulator)
that can operate the included programs from a desktop.

<p>This program can be run either from the command line ("inputsimulator") or 
via

<pre>
    dex XXX inputsimulator
</pre>

<p>If desired, inputsimulator can provide its input events on another Syzygy
input slot (say 1) like so:

<pre>
  inputsimulator 1
</pre>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p><img src="images/inputsimulator.png" height=400 width=400>
</td>
<td>
<p><img src="images/inputsimulator2.png" height=400 width=400>
</td>
</table>

<p>While executing, inputsimulator opens a window showing a view from behind 
into a 10-foot cubical space (reminiscent of the inside of our CUBE). 
A wireframe sphere in the center represents the subject's head (initially 
facing away from us). The other visible object represents a wand with eight
buttons. inputsimulator sends data to the application, specifying the position 
and orientation of the head and of the wand and the state of the wand's 
buttons. To better support two button mice (which are the norm on Windows
laptops), the inputsimulator starts out with the buttons organized in 2
columns, with the left and right mouse buttons corresponding to the left
and right buttons in the currently selected row. The user changes the selected 
row by pressing the space bar. If a middle mouse button exists and the user
presses it, the layout of simulated wand buttons changes so that there are 3
buttons in a row, with the left, middle, and right nouse buttons mapping to 
them in the obvious way.

<p>When using the simulator, there are several modes, selected by the keys
1-7. 
<p><ol>
<li>Move the head. Mousing with the left button down moves head in the screen 
   plane. Mouse with the right button down moves head into/ out of the screen.
<li>Rotate head. Mousing with the left button down rotates head around the 
   y axis. Mouse with the right button down rotates the head around the x 
   axis. PLEASE NOTE: Whether or not head rotation noticeably affects the
   images displayed by your application depends on how you've configured the
   viewing camera. In Syzygy, the default VR camera is head-mounted. In this
   case, rotating the head will rotate the field of view in the virtual world.
   On the other hand, if a fixed-screen VR camera is used (as would be
   desirable for a CAVE environment), rotating the head will cause only a
   small change in the displayed image.
<li>Translate wand: Mousing with the left button down translates the wand in 
   the screen plane. Mouse with the right button down translates the wand into
   and out of the screen. 
<li>Translate wand & use buttons: Mouse movement translates the wand in the
   x-y plane. Pressing mouse buttons activates the device buttons.
<li>Rotate the wand & use buttons: Mouse movement causes the wand to rotate.
   Pressing buttons activates the mouse buttons. 
<li>Use the joystick: While a mouse button is pressed,
   mousing moves the joystick.
<li>Rotate the world: When a mouse button is pressed, the view rotates around
   the y axis.
<li>The inputsimulator program emulates the use of a wand with 8 buttons.
    By pressing the space bar, you cycle through the rows of simulated wand
    buttons, with the currently selected row designated by a small white dot.
