<p><font size=+2>Syzygy: Getting the Software</font>

<p>Syzygy works and is tested on reasonably modern versions of 
Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Irix, as outlined 
<a href="Testing.html">here</a>, a document every user should read. 
In general, you'll want to look at the 
<a href="SupportingLibraries.html">chapter</a> on installing supporting 
libraries for Syzygy compilation.

<p>If you are downloading and using the precompiled binaries/API, you can 
simply look at the list of Syzygy software <a href="#Packages">packages</a>
to familiarize yourself with what is available and then proceed to 
this <a href="#OSEasyInstructions">section</a>
to install the binaries. If you are building the software yourself, start 
reading this chapter from the beginning. You will only need to read about 
compiling the Python bindings if you will be building them for running Python 
programs.

<p>Finally, once you've gotten familiar with the basic build process, you might
want to explore the advanced Makefile targets supported by the Syzygy build 
structure. One use of these <a href="#AdvancedTargets">targets</a> is creating 
the binary installable szg packages.

<A NAME="Packages">
<p><font size=+2>Software Packages</font>
</a>

<p>The following software (and data) packages are part of the Syzygy 
distribution:

<a href="ExampleCode.html">here</a>. 
<li>szgdata-0.7.tar.gz: Data necessary for the sample applications, as outlined
<a href="ExampleCode.html">here</a>, but excluding some particularly large 
files, which are available by request.
<li>py-szg-0.7.tar.gz: Python bindings for Syzygy.

<A NAME="OSEasyInstructions">
<p><font size=+2>OS-Specific Precompiled Install Instructions</font>
</a>

<p>For all platforms, unpack the precompiled distribution to a directory 
szg-0.7. To run Syzygy programs you will need to, assuming that $SZGHOME is 
the location of the new directory:

<p><ul>
<li>Linux: Add $SZGHOME/bin to the front of your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $PATH. 
By setting your dynamic library search path, you enable the runtime linker to
find the Syzygy shared libaries.
<li>Win32: Add $SZGHOME/bin to your $PATH variable.
<li>Mac OS X: Add $SZGHOME/bin to the front of your $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and 
$PATH.
<li>Irix: Add $SZGHOME/bin to the front of your $LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH and $PATH.
</ul>


<A NAME="OSBuildInstructions">
<p><font size=+2>OS-Specific Build Instructions</font>
</a>

<p>Linux: 
<p><ol>
<li>X11 and ncurses development packages are required for compilation. 
  Your distribution might not install these by default.
<li>GLUT is required for compilation as well. Either install a GLUT development
  package via your distribution or install GLUT in Syzygy's external build 
  libraries, as described <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a>.
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: the Syzygy build environment produces code for the i686 
  architecture by default.If you have an older processor, you need to change 
  the "-march=i686" flag in szg/build/make/Makefile.vars. Experiment with 
  either removing it or downgrading, for instance to "-march=i586".
</ol>

<p>Windows: 

<p><ol>
<li>Syzygy's build system uses GNU make and the command line Visual Studio
  compiler and linker. This has been tested with Visual Studio 6.0 
  (in combination with STLPort) and Visual Studio .Net.
<li>You will need a unix-like shell for Windows that provides a GNU make 
    utility. We have tested two, MinGW/MSYS and Cygwin. If you're not 
    currently using either (and are not using Windows 98, see below), we 
    recommend MinGW. Cygwin is a much larger package, comprising an entire 
    Unix system, and is only available via a network installer. On the other 
    hand, MinGW is relatively small and comes as two self-contained installers.
<li>Syzygy programs expect to be able to scrape their name from the 
    command-line args. The Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP (cmd.exe) 
    shells all work. Unfortunately, the Win98 cmd.exe shell mangles argv[0], 
    interfering with Syzygy's proper operation. The cygwin shell does, however,
    work with Syzygy on all Windows versions, including Windows 98. 
    Consequently, we recommend using installing and using the cygwin shell on 
    Windows 98.
<li>To install MinGW, run the MinGW installer first (which gives you the 
    underlying system) and then the MSYS installer (which gives you the 
    Unix-like shell needed to run the commands).  Please note, the MSYS shell, 
    as of this writing, has a hard time outputing text from Syzygy programs. 
    Consequently, we recommend running Syzygy commands from a regular Windows 
    shell (cmd.exe) and only compiling in MSYS. This workaround means that 
    MinGW is unsuitable for Win98, where cygwin should be used instead.
<li>You might prefer to install cygwin 
    (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">www.cygwin.com</a>) if you want more 
    Unix functionality from the command line than MinGW provides. You can 
    create a minimum-disk-space Cygwin which will still build Syzygy by 
    selecting only these packages (uncheck <i>all</i> other checkboxes):
    <dl>
    <dt>Category: Base
        <dd>ash bash cygwin fileutils login sh-utils
    <dt>Category: Devel
        <dd>bin-utils make
    <dt>Category: Shells
        <dd>ash bash sh-utils
    </dl>
<li>Install MS Visual Studio. If you are using Visual Studo 6, you'll also 
    need STLport to replace VC-6's non-threadsafe STL. With Visual Studio .NET 
    (i.e. 7), STLport is not necessary. Consequently, we recommend Visual 
    Studio .NET for Syzygy compilation. Please see 
    <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a> for instructions. 
<li>To compile from the command-line, Visual Studio needs several enviroment 
    variables to be set appropriately. Please see 
    <a href="VisualStudioBuildVars.html">here</a> for details.
<li>You will need to install GLUT, as described in the Windows section of this 
    <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">chapter</a>. Please note that, in the 
    past, we encouraged users to install the glut headers and library in the 
    Visual Studio directory. While this is still possible, the prefered Syzygy 
    way is to install it in a known, external location.
<li>Launch a (MSYS or Cygwin) shell. Try running cl.exe (the compiler), 
    link.exe (the linker), and make. If these all run, you can begin compiling.
</ol>

<p>Mac OS X: 
<p>The Syzygy shared library code uses dlopen, as is provided in 
  szg/contrib/dlcompat. You must compile this first:
<p><ul>
<li> cd szg/contrib/dlcompat
<li> make
</ul>

<p>Irix: 
<p>Either install GLUT on your machine in the normal Unix way or follow the 
SGI instructions <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a> to install
GLUT in a Syzygy-specific way, which does not require "root".

<a NAME="BuildEnvVar">
<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Build Environment Variables</font>
</a>

<p>The Syzygy build process uses recursive make. A top-level Makefile in
szg/build guesses the operating system and executes a machine-specific Makefile
in a subdirectory. For instance, on a Windows machine, the Syzygy shared library
libarLanguage.dll would be built in szg/build/win32/language, but, on a Linux
system, libarLanguage.so would be built in
szg/build/linux/language. The Makefile guesses the operating system
via uname, defaulting to the OSTYPE environment variable if this fails. 
If the top-level makefile fails to guess your machine type, you can fix the 
problem by setting $OSTYPE (to "linux" or "cygwin", for instance).

<p>To build Syzygy, You MUST set SZGHOME to the top-level Syzygy install
directory. You will probably also want to set SZGBIN, which lets you
designate the directory where executables and shared libraries will be installed,
and SZGEXTERNAL, which points to the installed location of external libraries
(see <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a>), but setting these variables
is optional. 

<p>On Windows, when setting directories with these environment variables
  <i>use forward slashes instead of backslashes</i> and do NOT use the cygwin
  abbreviations "/cygdrive/d" or "/d" for "d:". Otherwise, the shell/compiler
  combination will misinterpret them. For example, you should use:
<pre>
  SZGHOME=D:/szg
  SZGEXTERNAL=g:/public
</pre>

<p>The following environment variables are meaningful on all systems:

<p><ul>
<li>SZGHOME: (required) The top-level syzygy directory 
  (for instance, /home/user1/szg).
<li>SZGBIN: (optional) The directory where the built binaries and shared libraries
  should be placed. If this is not set it defaults to
  szg/bin/$(MACHINE_TYPE), where MACHINE_TYPE is one of linux, win32, darwin,
  mips3, or mips4. The last two possibilities refer to SGI processor families.
<li>SZGEXTERNAL: (optional) The location of external
  libraries, such as those providing sound. If this is not set, 
  the code will compile but disable support for such features.
  The arrangement of the 
<li>SZGDEBUG: (optional) If set to "TRUE", a debug build will be produced.
<li>SZG_DEVELOPER_STYLE: (optional) If set to "EASY", the build assumes that the
  Syzygy headers and libraries are arranged as in one of the precompiled
  binary distributions, such as szg-0.7-linux.tar.gz. See 
  <a href="Programming.html">this</a> chapter for further information.
  Please note, by default the code assumes that the Syzygy headers and
  libraries are arranged as in the "developer" version (szg-0.7.tar.gz) you
  compile yourself.
<li>SZG_MULTITEX: (optional) Some platforms (especially recent Linux distributions) 
  do not support the multitexturing tricks of the q33 demo. Set this to "FALSE" to
  let q33 compile on those platforms.
</ul>

<p>The following environment variables only have meaning on Windows.
<p><ul>
<li>SZG_STLPORT: (optional) Visual Studio 6's STL implementation is insufficent to
  run Syzygy. In this case, STLport must be dropped in. To do so, set this
  environment variable to "TRUE". Please note, the default is NOT to try to
  use STLport. We assume that most users will be on Visual Studio .NET.
<li>SZG_USE_PCH: (optional) To get the Windows build reasonably fast, precompiled headers
  must be used (the default). However, these are extremely sensitive 
  to minor differences in Visual Studio patch level. Consequently, sometimes it is 
  convenient to be able to turn off precompiled headers by setting this variable to "FALSE".
</ul>

<A NAME="CompileSyzygy">
<p><font size=+2>Compiling the Syzygy Library</font> 
</a>

<p>Make sure you have followed the following specific guidelines for your
   platform (if any):
<p><ul>
<li>Windows: 
  <ol>
  <li>If using Visual Studio 6, you must install STLport as outlined 
      <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a>, and SZG_STLPORT must be
      set to "TRUE".
  <li>If using Visual Studio .NET, do NOT use STLport. SZG_STLPORT must
      be unset or "FALSE".
  <li>Remember to set paths appropriately as outlined 
      <a href="#BuildEnvVar">here</a>, specifically like "d:/szg".
  </ol>
<li>Irix: Be sure to use "gmake" instead of "make", since Syzygy Makefiles
    follow the GNU syntax.
</ul>

<p><ol>
<li>Unpack szg.tar.gz.
<li>You MUST set $SZGHOME appropriately and
    should optionally set other variables (<a href="#BuildEnvVar">see here</a>).
<li>In szg/build, type "make". Note that "make clean" does the expected thing.
    On Windows this must be done from a cygwin or MinGW shell since syzygy uses GNU make.
    On Irix, you MUST use "gmake" instead of "make", since Syzygy uses GNU make syntax.
<li>If the supporting libraries are not properly installed 
    (see <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a>), then Syzygy will build, but 
    certain capabilities, such as sound, will be disabled.
</ol>

<p>Potential problems:

<p><ul>
<li>If SZGBIN is set but isn't a directory, the cp command at the
    end of each step in the recursive make will fail.
<li>On most systems, the build system will automatically guess the
    system type and proceed. But if the build fails with
    "Makefile failed to guess OS type", manually set the environment variable 
    OSTYPE to one of linux, cygwin, darwin, or irix and try again.
<li>If cygwin was not installed properly, you might not have gotten "make"
    or "ar". In this case, the build will fail, complaining that it can't find
    the relevant executable. Please try installing cygwin again, this time
    making sure the packages mentioned <a href="#OSBuildInstructions">here</a>
    are included.
</ul>

<p>This process will build a collection of shared libraries that collectively
comprise the Syzygy toolkit (shown here with Linux/Irix extensions):

<p><ul>
<li>libarLanguage.so
<li>libarPhleet.so
<li>libarBarrier.so
<li>libarMath.so
<li>libarDrivers.so
<li>libarGraphics.so
<li>libarSound.so
<li>libarObject.so
<li>libarInteraction.so
<li>libarFramework.so
</ul>

<p>It will also compile a collection of plugins for the input framework (for instance
various device drivers), infrastructure programs like szgserver, and utility programs like
dkillall.

<p>You can also build individual shared libraries, which can be very convenient 
during development. To build the objects derived from src/language, for instance, 
run "make" (or "gmake" on
Irix) in the directory szg/build/$(MACHINE_TYPE)/language, where MACHINE_TYPE is
one of linux, win32, darwin, mips3, or mips4.

<A NAME="CompileDemos1">
<p><font size=+2>Compiling the Sample Applications in szg</font>
</a>

<p>Many sample applications are included with the Syzygy code, and they are
described <a href="ExampleCode.html">here</a>. The first group is
included in the base distribution itself, with code located at szg/src/demo.
The only sample application here that requires additional (external) libraries
to build is q33, a Quake III level viewer. However, you will not need to install
anything additional to build the rest.

<p><ol>
<li>atlantis
<li>avn
<li>coaster
<li>cosmos
<li>cubes
<li>hspace
<li>parade
<li>q33: Needs additional libraries to build.
<li>ribbons
<li>schprel
<li>timetunnel
<li>volume
</ol>

<p><ol>
<li>Make sure that SZGHOME, SZGBIN, SZGEXTERNAL, etc. are set-up as
   before.
<li>To build all the samples, in szg/build type "make demo", which will
   result in the executables being placed in $SZGBIN, if that environment
   variable has been set, and, otherwise, the default location. 
   The "demo" target also rebuilds the toolkit ("make") if needed.
   If one sample application fails to build, it continues to the next.
   You can clean the demo directories with "make demo-clean".
<li>To understand how to install the external libraries for building
   q33, go <a href="SupportingLibraries.html">here</a>.
</ol>

<p>It is also possible to build the demos individually. For example, to build the "cosmos"
demo on a Linux machine, go to

<pre>
  szg/build/linux/demo/cosmos
</pre>

and invoke make. As above, for this to work properly, the build environment
variables must be set appropriately.

<A NAME="CompileVMAT">
<p><font size=+2>Compiling the VMAT Physics Library</font>
</a>

<p><ol>
<li>VMAT stands for "virtual materials".
<li>Unpack vmat-X.X.tar.gz to the directory "vmat".
<li>The environment variables SZGHOME, SZGBIN, SZGEXTERNAL must be set as before.
<li>From the top level directory, "make" and "make clean"
do the expected thing. This builds the library libvmat.so (Linux/Irix suffix)
and the testvmat sample application. These are both copied into $SZGBIN, if
it is defined, and otherwise into the default location for executables.
<li>To enable other applications to use this library, set the environment
variable VMATHOME to the location of the vmat directory.
</ol>

<A NAME="CompileDemos2">
<p><font size=+2>Compiling the Sample Applications in szgdemo</font>
</a>

<p>The number of example applications included in the base distribution
is limited, with additional samples being included in the szgdemo
software package as they are developed.

<p><ol>
<li>bigpicture: Needs additional libraries to build.
<li>cubecake: Needs additional libraries to build.
<li>danceparty
<li>info-forest

<li>VRMLView: Needs additional libraries to build.
<li>vtkfile: Needs additional libraries to build.
<li>warpeace
<li>zyspace
</ol>

<p><ol>
<li>Obtain the source distribution szgdemo-X.X.tar.gz and extract
to the directory szgdemo. 
<li>The build environment variables SZGHOME, SZGBIN, SZGEXTERNAL, etc.
need to be set as before. To build "performance", VMATHOME will need
to be set, as <a href="#CompileVMAT">here</a>.
<li>Go into szgdemo and type "make". This will build all the samples
for which needed libraries are present, with successfully built executables
going into $SZGBIN, if defined, and otherwise into the default location.
 If a sample will not build,
the make goes on to the next one. "make clean" does the expected thing.
<li>You can build an individual sample by entering its directory and typing
"make". 
</ol>

<A NAME="CompilePythonBindings">
<p><font size=+2>Compiling the Syzygy Python Bindings</font>
</a>

<p>So far, the Syzygy Python bindings are supported on Linux, Windows, and
Mac OS X, but not on Irix. You will need to make sure you have Python installed
before proceeding. Version 2.2 is the minimum one required. Later versions will
also work. You should have SZGHOME, SZGBIN, SZGEXTERNAL, etc. set appropriately,
as before.

<p>Regarding Windows, please note that, if you have a Python or SWIG through cygwin, 
they should be removed in favor of native Windows versions of these pieces of
software. A cygwin Python has gcc's object format, whereas the Syzygy library for
Windows has Visual Studio's object format, and, consequently, cannot be loaded by
the Python interpreter. The native Windows Python can be downloaded from the
Python <a href="www.python.org">website</a>.

<p><ol>
<li>We now start describing how to compile the bindings. First, you will need to 
install a recent version of SWIG (an automatic wrapper generator). A version number of at 
least 1.3.21 is required. The procedure depends on your platform.
  <ul>
  <li>On Linux or OS X, download a tar.gz from the SWIG 
  <a href="www.swig.org">website</a>. Install this in the
  normal Unix way (configure, make, make install).
  <li>For Windows, download the SWIG installer from the website.
  Install the software and add the bin directory to your path.
  </ul>
<li>Next, you need to set the SZG_PYINCLUDE environment variable. This gives the
  directory where the Python.h header lives.
  <ul>
  <li>Linux: On Xandros 2.0, this lives at: /usr/include/python2.3
  <li>Windows: Assuming the installer puts its cargo in the top level of the c: drive and that we
  have Python version 2.2: g:/Python22/include.
  <li>OS X: On OS X.3, this lives at: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/include/python2.3
  </ul>
<li> Finally, you need to set the SZG_PYLIB environment variable, which tells the
  compiler the location of the Python shared library.
  <ul>
  <li>Linux: Not necessary to set this variable, assuming that Python was installed
  in a standard way. Under these circumstances, the library will be on the search path.
  <li>Assuming the installer puts its cargo in the top level of the C: drive, c:/Python22/libs/python22.lib.
  <li>OS X: Not necessary to set this variable, assuming that Python was installed
  in a standard way. Under these circumstances, the library will be on the search path.
  </ul>
<li>Unpack py-szg-X.X.tar.gz to the directory py-szg. In the top level, "make" and
  "make clean" do the expected thing.
</ol>

<A NAME="AdvancedTargets">

<p><ul>
<li>create-install: In Makefile.rules and top-level Makefile.
<li>install-clean: Top-level Makefile only.
