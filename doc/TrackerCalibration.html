<font size=+2>Tracker Calibration for VR</font>
<p>Tracking, or deriving information about the physical position of objects,
and using that information to control the placement of items in the virtual
world is critical for virtual reality. Since true reality displays relative
to a person's head, virtual reality must do likewise, necessitating head
tracking. Furthermore, users of virtual environments often want to manipulate
simulated objects within them, possibly by  pointing at them or touching them.
To enable this interaction modality, the position and orientation of a
pointing or touching device (or maybe just the user's hands) must be available.

<p>In general, mapping the virtual world to the physical world is a complicated
process. First, there is the coordinate system of the virtual world. Next,
there is the coordinate system of the physical world. Finally, there is the
inherent coordinate system of the tracking device and its mapping into the
physical world. As an overall goal, the tracking device's output should form a
bridge between the virtual world and the physical one: overlaying one on the
other so that a user can manipulate objects in the virtual world as if they
were present in the real one.
