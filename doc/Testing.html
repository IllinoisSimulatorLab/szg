<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Tested Configurations</font>

<p>Syzygy is portable across a range of modern operating systems,
Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, and Irix. Testing is complicated because
Syzygy supports heterogeneous clustering, which
increases the number of scenarios that must be investigated.

<p>The Syzygy developers have access to the following systems. 
For obvious reasons, these are the supported platforms. However,
similar systems will likely also work. Any modern Linux is likely
to be fine.
<p><ul>
<li>Linux, RedHat 6.2, 6.3, 8.0, and 9.0 are tested and OK.
    Redhat 7.1 and 7.2 have stability problems due to gcc on
    SMP computers.
<li>Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP. Windows 98 will also work
    in conjunction with cygwin. SMP fine on all platforms.
<li>Mac OS X 10.2.4 and above. Earlier versions of Mac OS X will
    work, but will be less convenient to use. For instance, early
    versions of Mac OS X would not let glut programs launched
    from the command line get keyboard focus. 
<li>Irix 6.5 (stability problems on some machines... see below)
</ul>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE (Syzygy on Linux): Syzygy depends on a thread-safe libc++ for
stability. The libc++ shipped with RedHat 7.1 is NOT thread-safe
due to gcc-2.96. This platform thus experiences slight instability
when running Syzygy (most noticeable on SMP machines). Upgrade
to a modern Linux (and a gcc-3.x) to fix this. As a work-around, 
if you cannot upgrade to a newer Linux, try running a uniprocessor kernel. 
This vastly improves stability.

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE (Syzygy on Irix): As with Linux. Syzygy depends on a 
thread-safe libc++ for stability. On a 4-processor deskside Onyx running
Irix 6.5 and using CC 7.2, some of the server components are unstable
(szgserver for instance). The symptoms are the same as on the Linux side
(for gcc versions which produce non-threadsafe c++ code). Experimentation has
yet to determine whether a newer version of CC will improve matters or if
the current version can be induced to create threadsafe code.

<p>Syzygy programs will run on Windows 98 also. However, it is impossible
for an executable to get its own name (other than in all capital letters)
from argv[0] when run from cmd.exe (the default Windows shell). 
Since Syzygy uses the command line argv[0] (in most cases) to set the
component name, this causes problems with automated operation of the
distributed system, for instance when running an application on a virtual
computer, one of whose nodes is Win98. As a work-around, three components 
(szgd, DeviceServer, and SoundRender) manually set their component names.
Thus, Win98 nodes in a virtual computer can host input devices (via 
DeviceServer) and can also emit sounds (via SoundRender). Finally,
components can retrieve the name from the argv[0] when launched via the
cygwin shell. Consequently, normal operation of the distributed system is
assured if you only launch components from the cygwin shell when on Win98. 

<p><font size=+2>Wildcat Graphics Cards: Specifics</font>

<p>While the Syzygy network-based framelocking scheme works well 
with most graphics
cards, the Wildcat series of graphics cards needs to also have its internal
framelocking feature enabled for quality results. To enable framelocking for
a given rendering machine (in this case vr1):

<pre>
  vr1 SZG_RENDER wildcat_framelock true
</pre>

<p>Note that the default is to have wildcat framelocking (i.e. the internal
framelocking on the card) disabled.

<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Validation Procedures</font>

<p><ul>
<li>Each supported platform runs szgserver and szgd. The szgserver 
communicates with clients on each of the supported platforms.
<li>Successfully run a distributed scene graph application on
each of the supported platforms. Connected display clients work
on each supported platform.
<li>Successfully run a master/slave application on each of the
supported platforms. Slaves run on each of the supported platforms.
<li>The following is the "stress test" currently used to validate the
system. Given a 3x2 video wall with some Windows and some Linux
components. All of the computers have dual processors and two
network cards, one connected to the internet and one connected to
a private gigabit network. A seventh trigger computer also exists,
a dual processor Linux computer, with similar networking capabilities.
This seventh computer also runs the szgserver. A script launches
applications at 3 second intervals. 4000 applications launches are
required without a problem before the software is said to be 
sufficiently stable.
</ul>

<p>This procedure is not complete but is a good start.
