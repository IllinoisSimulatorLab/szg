<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Tested Configurations</font>

<p>Syzygy uses the following combination of technologies, influencing
the platforms on which it can compile and run. As of 2004, this requirement
set has become mainstream, and, because a development goal is not to expand
it further, building and running Syzygy should require only trailing edge 
features of the one's development environment in the future, a desirable
characteristic.

<p><ul>
<li>OS with preemptive multitasking and threading.
<li>Thread-safe STL and standard C/C++ library.
<li>Good support for dynamic libraries and loadable modules, along with
the ability to pass STL objects across module boundaries.
<li>Graphics support depends on OpenGL.
</ul>

<p>Syzygy is portable across a range of modern operating systems,
Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, and Irix. It is stable on these systems, with the
stability subjected to rigorous testing, as noted below. Furthermore,
it is stable and tested across heterogenous combinations of these systems:
your clusters need not be comprised of one type of machine.

<p>Any new (as of summer 2004) system should compile and run Syzygy.
Some specific information about a wider range of systems follows.
<p><ul>
<li>Any modern linux should compile and run Syzygy. The developers have
    successfully run and built Syzygy on RedHat 6.2, 6.3, 8.0, 9.0, the various
    Fedora releases, along with Xandros 2.0 and 3.0. Currently, the developers
    are compiling using gcc 3.x, so it could be that earlier versions (as
    would have shipped with RedHat 6.x) will no longer compile the code base.
    gcc 2.96 failed the thread-safe STL test mentioned above (it was a flawed
    release coming after the egcs merge) and, consequently, Redhat 7.1 and 
    7.2 should NOT be used.
<li>Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP. Windows 98 will also work
    in conjunction with cygwin. Visual Studio 6 works in combination with
    STLport (since the STL shipping with this product does not allow STL
    objects to cross module boundaries). Visual Studio .NET works.
<li>Mac OS X 10.3 is required. A bug in the gcc shipped with Apple's 10.2
    development tools prevents Syzygy code from being built as dylibs.
<li>Irix 6.5 and a recent (summer 2004) version of CC is required. Previous
    versions of CC would not produce thread-safe STL code.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2>Special Notes for Windows 98</font>

<p>The problem with Windows 98 derives from the way in which Syzygy components
automatically determine their names for connecting to the phleet distributed
OS. On Windows 98, it is impossible
for an executable to get its own name (other than in all capital letters)
from argv[0] when run from cmd.exe (the default Windows shell). 
Since Syzygy uses the command line argv[0] (in most cases) to set the
component name, this causes problems with automated operation of the
distributed system, for instance when running an application on a 
"virtual computer", one of whose nodes is Win98. 
As a work-around, three components 
(szgd, DeviceServer, and SoundRender) manually set their component names.
Thus, Win98 nodes in a virtual computer can host input devices (via 
DeviceServer) and can also emit sounds (via SoundRender). Finally,
components can retrieve the correct name from the argv[0] when launched via the
cygwin shell. Consequently, normal operation of the distributed system is
assured if you only launch components from the cygwin shell when on Win98. 
<p>Running a syzygy program from an incorrectly configured Win98 DOS shell can
fail. If this happens, try unchecking "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs
from detecting Windows".

<p><font size=+2>Wildcat Graphics Cards: Specifics</font>

<p>While the Syzygy network-based framelocking scheme works well 
with most graphics
cards, the Wildcat series of graphics cards needs to also have its internal
framelocking feature enabled for top quality results (i.e. anecdotally, 100%
quality vs. 99% quality). To enable framelocking for
a given rendering machine (in this case vr1):

<pre>
  vr1 SZG_RENDER wildcat_framelock true
</pre>

<p>Note that the default is to have wildcat framelocking (i.e. the internal
framelocking on the card) disabled.

<p><font size=+2>Syzygy Validation Procedures</font>

<p>Syzygy is stable enough that it can now be used to reliably detect bugs
and misconfigurations in the hardware/OS upon which it is being run. The
following tests thoroughly exercise the system, though they have yet to be 
automated.

<p><ul>
<li>Some small self-contained unit tests exist. These should run and pass
on each supported platform.
  <ul>
  <li> TestLanguage: Tests the data marshalling/de-marshalling along with
       some elementary file and directory operations. Tests binary and XML
       data reading/writing, both in memory and to and from files. 
       Performance information is returned. It also tests STL thread-safety 
       of the platform.
  <li> TestLanguageServer/ TestLanguageClient: Tests send/receiving of
       binary and XML data records across a network connection. Can be
       used to test a network link's speed (10 Mbit vs. 100 Mbit vs. 1 Gbit).
       Performance information is returned.
  <li> TestMath: Makes sure that the math functions (simple vector and
       matrix algebra plus some VR-specific projection matrices) do the
       right thing.
  <li> phleettest: This test hammers a running szgserver from multiple threads
       with various requests. Running several of these simultaneously is
       a good test of the szgserver's stability (and immunity to memory leaks).
  <li> BarrierServer/BarrierClient: Tests synchronization performance. One
       BarrierServer is run along with multiple BarrierClient's, probably on 
       different machines. Performace, in terms of number of synchronizations
       per second is returned. Performance should be very close to one
       synchronization per slowest link ping time between pairs of machines
       running BarrierClient and BarrierServer. These programs should be
       able to run indefinitely and tolerate the BarrierServer being killed
       and restared, along with dynamically adding and subtracting 
       BarrierClient nodes.
  </ul>
<li>Each supported platform runs szgserver and szgd. The szgserver 
communicates with clients on each of the supported platforms. dhunt and
dlogin also work.
<li>Successfully run a distributed scene graph application on
each of the supported platforms. Connected display clients work
on each supported platform.
<li>Successfully run a master/slave application on each of the
supported platforms. Slaves run on each of the supported platforms.
<li>The following is the "stress test" currently used to validate the
system (here the phleet distributed OS and its application launching and
management features are stressed). Given a 3x2 video wall 
with some Windows and some Linux
components. All of the computers have dual processors and two
network cards, one connected to the internet and one connected to
a private gigabit network. A seventh trigger computer also exists,
a dual processor Linux computer, with similar networking capabilities.
This seventh computer also runs the szgserver. A script launches
applications at 3 second intervals. 4000 applications launches are
required without a problem before the software is said to be 
sufficiently stable.
<li>A scene graph application should run on a small cluster (say 3
rendering nodes) for a period of weeks.
<li>Frame synchronization in a running master/slave application should
satisfy certain "quality-of-service" guarantees, in terms of speed and
uniformity over a long period of time. No formal definition here... just
attempting to eyeball a Gantt chart measuring this in real-time over a
period of some minutes.
