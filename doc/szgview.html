<p>
<B>szgview</B> is an application to view <A HREF="Objects.html">objects
that Syzygy supports</a>.
To view a file, simply run
<pre>
  szgview myfile.ext
</pre>
or, if you have <A HREF="Objects.html">matching</a> HTR and OBJ files, run
<pre>
  szgview myanim.htr mymesh.obj
</pre>

<p>
The bar at the top of the screen displays the current mode; pressing <b>1</b>
will allow you to translate the object by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
<b>2</b> lets you rotate, and <b>3</b> scales the object.

<p>
If the file supports animation, a slider bar will appear at the
bottom of the screen. The current frame number is shown on the bottom
right, and the animation can be scrubbed through by dragging the 
small, grey slider box along the timeline. Additionally, pressing <B>k</B>
will play/pause the animation, and the <b>j</B> and <b>l</b> keys will
move back or forward one frame, respectively.

<p>
The <B>`</B> key (the one with tilde on it... just to the left of the "1" on
standard keyboards) cycles through different background colors, in case the
object is difficult to see against a certain background.
<p><p>
For debugging purposes, the <b>d</B> key dumps database connectivity information
to the console. Hitting <b>p</b> performs a "pretty dump", formatting the database
hierarchy.
