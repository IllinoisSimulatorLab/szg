dlcompat for Darwin
=========================

This is dlcompat, a small library that emulates the dlopen()
interface on top of Darwin's dyld API.

Unlike dlopen.c in cctools, this allows loading a ".dylib" 
library (as long as the RTLD_LOCAL flag isn't passed to dlopen()). It can 
be configured to yield a warning when trying to close it (dynamic 
libraries cannot be unloaded).

It automatically searches for modules in several directories (taken
from the environment variables DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
plus /usr/lib and /lib) when no absolute path is specified and the
module is not found in the current directory.

Installation
--------------
As root, type:

  make install

This will compile the source file, generate both a static and shared
library called libdl and install it into /usr/local/lib. The header
file dlfcn.h will be installed in /usr/local/include.

If you want to place the files somewhere else, run

  make clean
  make install prefix=<prefix>

where <prefix> is the hierarchy you want to install into, e.g. /usr
for /usr/lib and /usr/include (_NOT_ recommended!).

To enable warnings output (useful for people porting packages), run

  make clean
  make DEBUG=1
  make install

To enable debugging output, run

  make clean
  make debug
  make install

Usage
-------
Software that uses GNU autoconf will likely check for a library called
libdl, that's why I named it that way. For software that doesn't find
the library on its own, you must add a '-ldl' to the appropriate
Makefile (or environment) variable, usually LIBS.

If you installed dlcompat into a directory other than /usr/local/lib,
you must tell the compiler where to find it. Add '-L<prefix>/lib' to
LDFLAGS (or CFLAGS) and '-I<prefix>/include' to CPPFLAGS (or CFLAGS).

Notes
-----
If you are writing new software and plan to have Mac OX X compatibility you
should look at the dyld api's in /usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h, rather than
using dlcompat, using the native api's is the supported method of loading
dynamically on Mac OS X.

Also note that the functions in dlcompat are not thread safe. Also it is not
POSIX spec compliant.
