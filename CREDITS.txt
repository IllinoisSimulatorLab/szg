A big thanks to everyone who let us port their applications and redistribute
the code! Thanks to George Francis and crew, who generously shared their
mathematical visualizations. And thanks to Paul Rajlich for making the Quake
code available in a VR-friendly form. Please see the end of this document
for full demo credits. Furthermore, thanks very much to Bill Sherman whose
nice FreeVR library provided examples and inspiration on topics such as
flock-of-birds interface, shared-memory input device interface for legacy
applications, etc.

The szg library code incorporates the TinyXML library by Lee Thomason
(the license is compatible with the szg library license).

Thanks to Peter Brinkmann for creating the original version of the
Python bindings for Syzygy and to George Francis and students for
using them in their classes.

Jim, Camille- Fixed dozens of bugs.

Jim- Added partial support for the MinGW g++ compiler on Windows.

Jim- Added Scene Graph shared library plugins.

Jim- Added error reporting to arGUI XML parsing.

Contributors (core project), Syzygy-1.0

Release Jan 2006

LICENSE CHANGE! With the unanimous agreement of those you've contributed so
far, we're moving to a BSD-style license.

Ben- Added a logging feature, ar_log(), and partially converted the code's
couts/cerrs/printfs to use it.

Ben- Added more Python examples (doc/python)

Jim- Reworked the Syzygy docs to use a non-html base format (using txt2tags).

Contributors (core project), Syzygy-0.8

Release Dec 2005

Major contributions are listed, giving the name(s) of the responsible
developers. See the changelog for more info.

Ben- Reworked the arDatabase/arGraphicsDatabase/arGraphicsPeer API. Now there
is a decent thread-safety model. Reference counting for nodes has been
implemented. Python bindings are much improved.

Jim- Added a "predetermined harmony" mode to arMasterSlaveFramework.

Jim- Added good support for head-mounted displays. Now, the default view mode
uses head-mounting, which makes the inputsimulator rotate-head mode do
something more like what people expect (i.e. rotate the scene).

Jim- Renamed wandsimserver to inputsimulator and improved its interface,
most notably in adding better support for two button mice.

Lee- Created the arGUI windowing API. A significant chunk of work.

Contributors (core project), Syzygy-0.7

Release Feb 2005

Major contributions are listed in reverse chronological order, giving the
name of the responsible developer(s). See the changelog for more details.

Ben- Reworked DeviceServer to use loadable modules (plus an XML config file
as stored in a "global" database parameter).

Ben- Added support for shared libraries to Syzygy. Now, the Syzygy libraries
are built as shared libraries and loadable modules are supported (for
instance, for device drivers). 

Ben- Added support for "graphics peers", a generalization of arGraphicsServer
and arGraphicsClient.

Ben- Improvements to Phleet. Different virtual computers in the same
"location" can now cooperate. Also, fixed jamming issues in Phleet, 
introducing ubiquitous time-outs.

Peter and Jim: Created and did significant work on Syzygy Python bindings 
(see py-szg project).

Ben- Made an szg SDK. Created a new build mode ("EASY") to support it.

Jim- Reworked and generalized the graphics window code, allowing for
custom configuration of viewports and better camera handling (custom cameras 
for instance). The problematic arScreenObject class was removed.

Ben- Added "standalone" mode (in addition to "Phleet" mode, which already
existed).

Ben- Added IP whitelisting and filtering to the szgserver (similar to TCP 
wrappers).

Release Jan 2004

A little change in the credits format. Keep to the log style, though.

Contributions, Syzygy-0.61
--------------------------

Ben added true connection brokering to the Phleet, making zero config
clustering possible. Syzygy set-up was changed drastically, including
dropping dependency on DNS. The components were brought closer to being
able to deterministically shutdown. Data organization for the various
demos was changed to promote a saner data repository. Also, the Makefiles
were changed to have a saner and more maintainable external/lib and
external/include. Support for jpegs added.

Jim continued to work on the interaction code and developed the
arGraphicsWindow class, with corresponding enhancements to the different
kinds of window tilings available.

Camille did a pass through the code for correct form.

NOTE: we now distribute some Intersense source files (isense.c, isense.h,
and isenseTypes.h).

*Drew: Generously provided a Syzygy driver for the intersense trackers.
*Jim: Continuing improvements on the navigation framework.
*Ben: Fixed the "name translation" so that it would work with multi-token
host OS user names (as in windows). Added support for the frame-locking
feature on the wildcat boards. Fixed some compilation issues with q33
(basically punted... making sure it compiles as debug). Fixed the spacepad
driver.

*As usual, Camille worked doggedly on cleaning-up the code, factoring
out copy-paste, and, in general, making things look more like
professional C++.
*Mark turned us on to Doxygen, and while our auto-generated manual is
mediocre now, it'll probably be good soon!
*Jim worked hard on improving the event processing in the input framework.
And also made significant progress in adding a high-level user-interaction
and navigation framework to the input framework.
*Mark cleaned-up the OBJ support and added lib3DS support via lib3DS. He 
also started adding shader effects via CG. He also made our import
filters more coherent (descending from a common base class) and added the
nice szgview viewer application.
*Ben worked on adding more features to the scene graph API, making it more
OpenGL-like. He also added rudimentary XML input/output support, made some
improvements to the application frameworks (screenshot mechanism and pause
mechanism), and added a means to replay input events from files. Finally,
he worked on making the phleet more reliable.

Contributed software
--------------------

The Quake3 level viewer demo relies on libjpeg and zlib and needs
multithreaded versions of these libraries. We include "simplified"
versions of these code distributions with altered Makefiles so Windows
users can easily build versions of these libraries which are linked with
the multithreaded libc. Any problems are the fault of this process and
not the original authors!

zlib: Copyright 1995-1998 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler

 Matt Woodruff and Ben Bernard.
